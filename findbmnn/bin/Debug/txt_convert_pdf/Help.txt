q: which font should i install , otf or ttf?
a : if you have opentype capable software such as photoshop cc, any version of illustrator,  indesign, word ( new
versions) or any other software that is capable of accessing the extra characters in opentype fonts, you should
install the otf version in order to be able to easily access the ligatures and extra characters ( from the glyphs panel
or from the character panel/opentype features panels).
if you don’t have any opentype capable software, you can insall either version you prefer - there is not much
difference visually with this particular font.

a : a handy guide on how to install fonts properly can be found here:

words written with the font ( such as a customazeable greeting card website for example) - for this you will require
a “ custom creation license”
2.) when the font is to be used in web templates for sale or distribution.
q: can i use this pack in my mobile app?
a: you may use  this pack in your app only if the text is flat and part of a design. you may not use the font
live in a mobile app ( where users can create custom words with the font) - for this you require and “app license”
and a “custom creation license”. you may not use the illustrations as a feature in your mobile app.
