kidlit file guide & helpful hints!

thank you for your purchase of kidlit!  you may be wondering what all of the different versions are for.

if you’re using software that has quick and easy access to opentype features, like photoshop cc, illustrator, or indesign,
you can install just one file: kidlit.otf. this file has all of the alternate alphabets coded into it. just type a letter, highlight
it, and either select the contextual alternates button for alphabet 2, or the stylistic alternates button for alphabet 3.

if that sounds like gibberish to you, or if your software of choice doesn’t have easy opentype feature access, fear not!
you can install the three different alphabet files instead: kidlit-alphabet-1.otf, kidlit-alphabet-2.otf, and
kidlit-alphabet-3.otf. (i always recommend installing the otf versions, as they’re friendlier with most software;
however, if your software will only allow ttf files, those are included for you too!)

if you’re using the three separate alphabet files, you may find that you need to do some manual adjusting to get spacing
right when mixing the alphabets together. and note: alphabets 1 and 2 can work by themselves, but alphabet 3 is meant
to be used sparingly for emphasis; a lot of those swashes and flourishes overlap or bump into each other.

alphabet 1 contains all of the punctuation and numbers; 2 and 3 are primarily just letters. and i’ve created additional
sets of accented characters for both alphabet 2 and alphabet 3, allowing you even more variety!
