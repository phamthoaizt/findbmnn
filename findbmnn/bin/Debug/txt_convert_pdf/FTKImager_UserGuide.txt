using the keyboard, the variable data is set apart using [variable_data] format. steps that required the user to
click on a button or icon are indicated by bolded text. this italic font indicates a label or non-interactive item in
the user interface.

chapter 1  overview and installation of
ftk imager

ftk imager
ftk® imager is a data preview and imaging tool that lets you quickly assess electronic evidence to determine if
further analysis with a forensic tool such as accessdata® forensic toolkit® (ftk) is warranted. ftk imager can
also create perfect copies (forensic images) of computer data without making changes to the original evidence.
with ftk imager, you can:
create forensic images of local hard drives, floppy diskettes, zip disks, cds, and dvds, entire folders, or
individual files from various places within the media.
preview files and folders on local hard drives, network drives, floppy diskettes, zip disks, cds, and dvds
preview the contents of forensic images stored on the local machine or on a network drive
mount an image for a read-only view that leverages windows explorer to see the content of the image
exactly as the user saw it on the original drive.
export files and folders from forensic images.
see and recover files that have been deleted from the recycle bin, but have not yet been overwritten on
thedrive.
create hashes of files using either of the two hash functions available in ftk imager: message digest 5
(md5) and secure hash algorithm (sha-1).
generate hash reports for regular files and disk images (including files inside disk images) that you can
later use as a benchmark to prove the integrity of your case evidence. when a full drive is imaged, a hash
generated by ftk imager can be used to verify that the image hash and the drive hash match after the
image is created, and that the image has remained unchanged since acquisition.
important:  when using ftk imager to create a forensic image of a hard drive or other electronic device,
be sure you are using a hardware-based write-blocker. this ensures that your operating
system does not alter the original source drive when you attach it to your computer.
to prevent accidental or intentional manipulation of the original evidence, ftk imager makes a bit-for-bit
duplicate image of the media. the forensic image is identical in every way to the original, including file slack and
unallocated space or drive free space. this allows you to store the original media away, safe from harm while the
investigation proceeds using the image.
after you create an image of the data, you can then use accessdata forensic toolkit (ftk) to perform a
complete and thorough forensic examination and create a report of your findings.

installing ftk imager
ftk imager can be installed to the computer where it will be used, or it can be run from a portable device such
as a usb thumb drive connected to a machine in the field, so there is no need to install it on a suspect’s
computer in order to capture its image.

chapter 1 overview and installation of ftk imager    ftk imager |   10

installing locally
install ftk imager to a local hard drive when you intend to attach evidence hardware to that computer for
previewing and imaging evidence.
to install ftk imager
1.   browse to the ftk imager setup file, either from an installation disc, or from the saved file downloaded
from http://accessdata.com/support/adownloads. the following is an example of what you will find on the
web site, however, the version number and its md5 hash number will change.

figure 3-1 accessdata web site: imager downloads

2.   under utilities, look for ftk imager. click download to download the latest released version.
3.   click save file.
4.   browse to the location where you wish to save the install file, and click save.
5.   when the download is complete, browse to the location where it was saved.
6.   execute the setup file by double-clicking it.
7.   on the welcome screen, click next.
8.   read and accept the license agreement, then click next.
9.   do one of the following:
accept the default installation location.
browse to a different destination folder.
10.   click next.
11.   in the ready to install screen, click next.
12.   do one of the following:
mark the launch accessdata ftk imager box to force imager to run immediately after the install is
complete.
leave the box unmarked to run the newly installed program at a later time.
note:  on ms windows server 2008r2 running user account control (uac), marking the launch box
does nothing. you must manually run ftk imager after installation.
13.   click finish to complete the installation and close the wizard.

chapter 1 overview and installation of ftk imager    installing ftk imager |   11

installing to a portable device
there are two ways to use imager on a portable device:
copy the ftk imager lite files directly to the device, avoiding installing to a local computer first.
unzip the downloaded files to the portable drive and execute the file from there.
the ftk imager lite program has fewer files (only the essentials) and does not require a separate
installation, although you must unzip the downloaded file to extract its contents into a folder before use.
run the installation on a local computer, then copy the ftk imager folder from the [drive]:\program
files\accessdata\ftk imager to the thumb drive or other portable device.
once the ftk imager program files are saved to the portable media, that media can be connected to any
computer running a windows os, and the program file,
ftk imager.exe can be executed from the portable media device.
with either method, you will need to make a target drive available for saving the imaged data, and a reliable
write-blocker must still be used.

running ftk imager
ftk imager can be run in a variety of ways:

double-click on the desktop icon .
execute the ftk imager.exe file from a thumb drive.
click start > run > browse. browse to and select ftk imager.exe from the location it was installed to,
and add a command line switch as discussed below.

command line options
ftk imager supports three command line options:
/createdirlisting
creates a directory listing file in the folder where ftk imager.exe is run from.
sample:
"ftk imager.exe" /createdirlisting e:\precious.e01
/verifyimage
verifies an image when you specify the image path and filename.
sample:
"ftk imager.exe" /verifyimage e:\precious.e01
/enabledebuglog
enables logging to the ftkimagedebug.log file created in the folder you run ftk imager.exe from.
sample:
"ftk imager.exe" /enabledebuglog
note:  if you fail to specify an image when using the /createdirlisting
or /verifyimage options, an error message appears indicating no image was found.
to run ftk imager using the command line options
1.   close ftk imager, then from the windows start menu, click run.
2.   in the run text box, browse to the path and folder containing ftk imager.exe, then click open.

view panes
there are several basic view panes in ftk imager. they are described in this section.

evidence tree pane
the evidence tree pane (upper-left pane) displays added evidence items in a hierarchical tree. at the root of the
tree are the selected evidence sources. listed below each source are the folders and files it contains.
click the plus sign  next to a source or folder to expand the view to display its sub folders.
click the minus sign  next to an expanded source or folder to hide its contents.
when you select an object in the evidence tree, its contents are displayed in the file list. the properties of the
selected object, such as object type, location on the storage media, and size, are displayed in the properties
pane. any data contained in the selected object is displayed in the viewer pane.

file list pane
the file list pane shows the files and folders contained in whichever item is currently selected in the evidence
tree. it changes as your selection changes.

combination pane
ftk imager’s lower-left pane has three tabs: properties, hex value interpreter, and custom content sources.
each is described here.

properties
the properties tab displays a variety of information about the object currently selected in either the evidence
tree or the file list.

figure 4-5 the properties tab

properties include information such as object type, size, location on the storage media, flags, and time stamps.

chapter 2 the ftk imager user interface    the ftk imager ui |   18

hex value interpreter
the hex value interpreter tab converts hexadecimal values selected in the viewer into decimal integers and
possible time and date values.

figure 4-6 the hex value interpreter tab

to convert hexadecimal values, highlight one to eight adjacent bytes of hexadecimal code in the viewer. a
variety of possible interpretations of the selected code are automatically displayed in the hex value interpreter.

this feature is most useful if you are familiar with the internal code structure of different file types and know
exactly where to look for specific data patterns or time and date information.

custom content sources
each time you add an item to be included in a custom content image, it is listed here.

figure 4-7 the custom content sources tab

you can add, edit, and remove one or all sources, and create the image from here.
click edit to open the wild card options dialog box.

chapter 2 the ftk imager user interface    the ftk imager ui |   19

figure 4-8 wild card options

for more information, see creating custom content images (page 38).

viewer
the viewer shows the content of the currently selected file, based on the preview mode selected: natural, text,
or hex. see preview modes (page 21) for more information.
the content can be scrolled through so you can see the entire file content. in addition, with hex mode selected,
and the combo pane hex value interpreter open, the hex interpretation of text selected in the viewer pane can
be viewed simultaneously.

chapter 2 the ftk imager user interface    the ftk imager ui |   20

chapter 3  working with evidence

use ftk imager to preview evidence prior to creating the image file(s). you can then choose to image the entire
evidence object, or choose specific items to add to a custom content (ad1) image. this chapter discusses
working with evidence and using ftk imager to accomplish the creation of forensic images that meet your exact
needs.

previewing evidence
evidence items can be previewed prior to deciding what should be included in an image. beginning with ftk
imager 3.0 support is included for vxfs, exfat, and ext4 file systems.
w a r n i n g:  if the machine running ftk imager has an active internet connection and you are using imager to
preview html content from the systems cache, there is a potential risk associated with microsoft
security bulletin ms-09-054. accessdata recommends that, wherever possible, users not have an
active internet connection while imager is running.

preview modes
ftk imager offers three modes for previewing electronic data: automatic mode, text mode, and hex mode.
these modes are selectable from the mode menu, or from the toolbar, as introduced in chapter 2. each is
described in more detail here.

automatic mode
automatic mode automatically chooses the best method for previewing a file’s contents, according to the file
type. for example:
web pages, web-related graphics (jpegs and gifs), and any other media types for which internet
explorer plug-ins have been installed are displayed by an embedded version of internet explorer in the
viewer.
text files are displayed in the viewer as ascii or unicode characters.
file types that cannot be viewed in internet explorer are displayed outside of ftk imager in their native
application provided those applications are installed locally, and the appropriate file associations have
been configured in windows.
file types that cannot be viewed in internet explorer and that do not have a known native viewer are
displayed by default in hexadecimal mode in the viewer.

text mode
text mode allows you to preview a file’s contents as ascii or unicode characters, even if the file is not a text file.
this mode can be useful for viewing text and binary data that is not visible when a file is viewed in its native
application.

chapter 3 working with evidence    previewing evidence |   21

hex mode
hex mode allows you to view every byte of data in a file as hexadecimal code. you can use the hex value
interpreter to interpret hexadecimal values as decimal integers and possible time and date values.
note:  preview modes apply only when displaying file data. the data contained in folders or other non-file
objects is always displayed in hexadecimal format.

adding evidence items
you can add a single evidence item, or several at one time. these procedures are explained in this section.

adding a single evidence item
to add an evidence item to the evidence tree
1.   do one o f the following:
click file > add evidence item.
click the add evidence item button  on the toolbar.
2.   select the source type you want to preview, then click next.
3.   select the drive or browse to the source you want to preview, then click finish.
the evidence item appears in the evidence tree.
4.   repeat these steps to add more evidence items.

adding all attached devices
to add data from all of the devices attached to a machine
do one of the following:
click file > add all attached devices.
click the add all attached devices button  on the toolbar.
the add all attached devices function, also known as auto-mount, scans all connected physical and logical
devices for media. if no media is present in an attached device such as a cd- or dvd-rom or a dvd-rw, the
device is skipped.

image mounting
new beginning in version 3.0 of ftk imager, image mounting allows forensic images to be mounted as a drive
or physical device, for read-only viewing. this action opens the image as a drive and allows you to browse the
content in windows and other applications. supported types are raw/dd images, e01, s01, aff, ad1, and l01.
full disk images raw/dd, e01, and s01 can be mounted physically. partitions contained within full disk images,
as well as custom content images of ad1 and l01 formats can be mounted logically. the differences are
explained in this section.
note:  ad encrypted images can now be mounted as either a drive or a physical device. other types of
encrypted images are not supported for mounting as either a drive or physical device.

chapter 3 working with evidence    adding evidence items |   22

benefits of image mounting
the ability to mount an image with ftk imager provides the following benefits, and  you may find others as you
use the feature:
mount a full disk image with its partitions all at once; the disk is assigned a physicaldriven name and the
partitions are automatically assigned a drive letter beginning with either the first available, or any
available drive letter of your choice.
read a full disk image mounted physically, and assigned a physical drive n name using imager or using
any windows application that performs physical name querying.
read and write to the mounted image using a cache file. the original content is not altered.
mount images of multiple drives and/or partitions. the mounted images remain mounted until unmounted
or until imager is closed.
easily unmount mounted images in any order, individually or all at once.
view a logically mounted image in windows explorer as though it were a drive attached to the computer,
providing the following benefits:
view file types with windows associations in their native or associated application, when that
application is installed locally.
run anti-virus applications on the mounted image.
share and view the logically mounted image as a drive in windows explorer from remote computers
when remote access has been configured correctly.
copy files from the mounted image to another location.

prevent files from being copied into the mounted image from another location. (because the image is
read-only, there is no worry that a remote user, or any user, viewing the image will make a change that
would render the data invalid.)

characteristics of a logically mounted image
ad1 and l01 are both custom content images, and contain full file structure, but do not contain any drive
geometry other other physical drive data. thus, these images do not have the option of being mounted
physically.
note:  when logically mounting an image, the drive or partition size displays incorrectly in the windows start >
computer view. however, when you open the “drive” from there, the folders and files contained within the
mounted image do display correctly.

characteristics of a physically mounted image
when you mount an image physically, while it cannot be viewed by windows explorer, it can be viewed outside
of imager using any windows application that performs physical name querying.
e01, s01, aff, and 001 (raw/dd) images are drive images that have the disk, partition, and file structure as
well as drive data. a physical disk image can be mounted physically; and its disk image partition(s) can be
mounted logically.

chapter 3 working with evidence    adding evidence items |   23

mounting an image
to mount an image
1.   if you already have the desired image added as evidence in the imager evidence list, select that item,
then do step 2 to auto-populate the source box with the image file to be mounted, as shown in step 3.
if you do not already have the desired image added as evidence, begin with step 2.
2.   do one of the following:
click file >image mounting.
click the image mounting  button on the toolbar.
3.   type in the path and filename, or click browse to populate the source box with the path and filename of
the image to be mounted.

viewed using any windows application that performs physical name querying
block device/writable allows you to write to the evidence, make notes, and so forth. the changes and
notations are saved in a cache file, but no changes are made to the original. if
selected, provide path information for the cache file in the write cache folder field.
file system/read only reads the device as a read-only device that you can view using windows explorer.

8.   select the mount method to use for this mounting.
9.   when all mount options are selected, click mount.
all the related mount information will be displayed in the mapped image list.

click a mapping in the list, then ctrl-click individual mappings to select multiple non-contiguous
mappings.
click and drag to select multiple mounted images.
2.   click done to close the mount image to drive dialog and return to ftk imager.

removing evidence
when required, evidence items can be removed individually, or altogether. both methods are discussed in this
section.

removing a single evidence item
you can remove evidence items individually, or start over again by removing all evidence at once.
to remove an evidence item
1.   in the evidence tree, select the evidence item you want to remove.

chapter 3 working with evidence    removing evidence |   26

note:  you must select the entire evidence item to remove it; you cannot remove only part of an item.
2.   do one of the following:
click file > remove evidence item
click the remove evidence item button  on the toolbar.
the evidence item is removed from the evidence tree.

removing all evidence items
to remove all evidence items at once
do one of the following:
click file > remove all evidence items
click the remove all evidence items button   on the toolbar.
all evidence items are removed from the evidence tree.

obtaining protected registry files
the windows operating system does not allow you to copy or save live registry files. without ftk imager, users
have had to image their hard drive and then extract the registry files, or boot their computer from a boot disk
and copy the registry files from the inactive operating system on the drive. ftk imager provides a much easier
solution. it circumvents the windows operating system and its file locks, thus allowing you to copy the live
registry files.

acquiring protected registry files on a local machine
you can acquire the protected registry files using ftk imager running on the machine whose registry files you
need.
to acquire protected registry files on a local machine
1.   launch ftk imager.
2.   do one of the following:
click file > obtain protected files.
click the obtain protected files  button on the toolbar.
3.   specify a destination directory.
4.   select the option that suits your needs:
minimum files for login recovery: retrieves users, system, and sam files from which you can
recover a user’s account information.
password recovery and all registry files: retrieves users, system, sam, ntuser.dat, default,
security, software, and userdiff files from which you can recover account information and possible
passwords to other files. this list can also be imported to the accessdata password recovery tools,
such as prtk, and dna.
5.   click ok.
ftk imager exports the selected files to the designated location.
6.   add the files to the case.

chapter 3 working with evidence    obtaining protected registry files |   27

7.   to open the registry files, do one of the following:
click file > registry viewer.
right-click a registry file in the file list, then select registry viewer.
note:  these steps will not acquire protected files from a drive image; only from the live system running
imager. see the directions below to acquire protected files from a drive image.

using encrypted images
ftk imager can work with images that are encrypted with either efs or ad encryption.
the use of encrypted images is discussed below.

detecting efs encryption
you can check for encrypted data on a physical drive or an image with ftk imager. the following figure
represents a view of detected efs-encrypted files:

click file > detect encryption.
click the detect encryption button  on the toolbar.
the program scans the evidence and notifies you if encrypted files are located. as illustrated in the figure
above, efs encrypted files are indicated by a key icon, , in the evidence tree.
note:  this feature does not work with .l01 files.

ad encryption

encryption.
supported image types are:
ad1 (ad custom content)
e01 (encase compatible)
s01 (smart)
aff (advanced forensic format)
