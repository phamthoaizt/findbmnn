pinsetter file guide & helpful hints!

thank you for your purchase of pinsetter!  you may be wondering which versions to install.

if you’re using software that has quick and easy access to opentype features, like photoshop cc, illustrator, or indesign, you
can install just one file: pinsetter-complete.otf. this file has the alternate alphabets coded into it. just type a letter, highlight
it, and select the swash button for the middle size, and the stylistic alternates button for the tall size alternates.

if that sounds like gibberish to you, or if you know that your software of choice doesn’t have easy opentype feature access,
fear not!  you can also install all three alphabets as separate files! just install the littles, middles, and talls files. if you use
both types of software, feel free to install all four files, to cover your bases! (i always recommend installing the otf versions, as
they’re friendlier with most software; however, if your software will only allow ttf files, those are included for you too!)

if you’re using the separate files, you may find that you need to do some manual adjusting to get the spacing right when mixing
the alphabets together. both the littles and middles alphabets are built to stand on their own, but the talls alphabet is
designed primarily to snuggle around the littles letters.

all 3 separate alphabet files also contain over 200 accented characters for language support.
