but i want to thank them all for their help and criticism. byron
wien, in particular, has gone beyond the call of duty in reading and
commenting on, the manuscript at three different stages of develop-

graphics that illustrate the real-time experiment. larry chiarello
supplied the figures.
i also want to thank the team that contributed to the perform-

four hundred seventy-three million to one. those are the odds
against george soros compiling the investment record he did as the
mabger of the ~uantum fund from 1968 through 1993. his invest-
ing record is the most unimpeachable refutation of the random
walk hypothesis ever!
as a trader coming of age in the latter half of the frenetic 1970s
and the 1980s, the alchemy of finance was somewhat of a revolution-
ary book. remember, this was the period when trend following
and indexation were the vogue in investing. it was a time when
technical analysis (the study of price movemen? as a forecasting
tool) reached its zenith. traders of my generation armed them-
selves with charts and computer-generated graphics that predicted
future price direction. we sat day after day in front of screens, mes-
merized by blinking lights and everchangir~g numbers in a deafen-
ing cacophony of information overload. with the possible exception
of elliott wave theory, an intellectual framework for understand-
ing the course of social, political, and economic events was notice-
ably forgotten in favor of just making sure that one was part of the
ever-quickening process.
the alchemy of finance was a shot out of the dark for me. it let
me take a giant step forward by first taking a step backwards,
clarifying events that appeared so complex and so overwhelming.
during an era when so much money was made in larger than life
events, from the hunt brothers' squeeze of the silver market in
1979 to kkr1s takeover of rjr nabisco in 1989, mr. sorosls theory
of reflexivity is the first modern, nontechnical effort to describe

2 foreword
and forecast the dynamic interplay between the participants in
i the process. that is the brilliance of this book. it describes the dy-
namics of the path between points of extreme valuation and equi-
librium in the marketplace. this is particularly important for the
average investor. how many times have we been correctly long
near the bottom or short near the top of a major market move? but
our staying power with these positions has been weak (as well as
our returns) because of a lack of understanding of the path of big
price moves. soros gives us critical insight into that path and thus
more confidence in our investments. this constitutes 70% of any
successful investing campaign.
when i enter the inevitable losing streak that befalls every ill-
vestor, i pick up the alchemy and revisit mr. soros's campaigns.
+ studying how he coped with adversity provides an excellent tu-
torial for breaking the string of negative behaviors that occasion-
ally besets any investor. winning is infectious. and this book in
replete with examples of trading behaviors all would want to emu-
late. importantly, mr. soros's intellect gives him the confidence and
strength of his own convictions to stay with his positions even dur-
ing trying periods. in that sense, the alchemy joins edwin lefgvre's
reminiscences of a stock operator as a timeless instructional guide of
the marketplace. and as such, soros should beware! in the world
war i1 movie patton, my favorite scene is when u.s. general george
s. patton has just spent weeks studying the writing of his germany
adversary field marshall erwin rommel and is crushing him in an
epic tank battle in tunisia. patton, sensing victory as he peers onto
the battle field from his command post, growls, "rommel, you mag-
nificent bastard. i read your book! " enough said.
the alchemy is also an excellent economic and political hijiory oi
recent times. from unknowingly providing a blueprint as to how
the savings and loan fiasco in the united states would be resolved
six years in advance (page 124) to predicting the stock market crash
of 1987 two years in advance (page 181), soros reveals himself as the
great market visionary of our time.
history will probably remember mr. soros as the speculator who
tilted against the bank of england in 1992 (and freed the english
people from recession). his billion dollar score is simply too com-
pelling a story for scribes to overlook. mr. soros himself would
probably like to be remembered as a great economist or even scien-
tist. but i am going to remember him for something even more im-
portant, for which he does not receive the credit he deserves. he is

foreword 3
someone who genuinely cares about the state of the human condi-
tion and tries to better it. his myriad and monumental philan-
thropical efforts will qualify him as one of history's great
benefactors. even today at age 62, he pursues the activities of his
six foundations with the vigor and work ethic of a young turk on
the way up the financial ladder, working 18-hour days around the
globe on behalf of fjis causes. he does not just write checks, which
any wealthy person can do. he is a hands-on workaholic who mate-
rially impacts the quality of the lives of people less fortunate than
he. now this, this is a sign of greatness.

preface

seven eventful years have passed since the alchemy of finance was
first published. my investment fund, the quantum fund, has con-
tinued to flourish: shareholders have enjoyed average annual gains
of 35. .8% in the last seven years in spite of a setback in the crash of
1987. quantum fund has also spawned a number of offspring,
some of which are doing even better than the goose that is laying
the golden eggs. starting in 1989, we decided to distribute a por-
tion of our earnings to shareholders, either in cash or in shares of
the newly created funds. as a result, we now manage seven funds
with combined equity of over $10 billion.
i have become progressively less active in the management of the
funds. i was fortunate in meeting stanley druckenmiller through
the alchemy of finance. he was managing another fund at the time,
and he sought me out because he was intrigued by my book. we
started talking and, eventually, he joined my firm. at the begin-
ning, he found it difficult to work with me. although i gave him a
great deal of authority, he was inhibited by my presence and felt
that he was not doing as well as he had before joining my firm. for-
tunately, i was becoming increasingly involved in the revolutionary
process that led to the collapse of communism. i was establishing a
network of foundations throughout the communist world and it in-
volved travelling in places where communications were rather poor.
in the summer of 1989, i told stan that he must take full charge of
running the fund. since then we have had no difficulties.
i became the coach, and he became the competitor. our perfor-
mance improved and we embarked on a period of sustained growth.
in each of the last three years, we chalked up gains in excess of

preface 5
50%. although we hpve had two similar periods of prosperity pre-
viously, this qualifies as an exceptional performance in view of our
outlandish size. druckenmiller is not only a good fund manager, he
is also a good partner. under his leadership, we have been able to
enlarge and improve our management team so that it now has a
depth which it never had before. so it happened that i found the
reward for my philaqthropic activities in the prosperity of my busi-
ness. that prosperity enabled me to expand the foundation net-
work at a breakneck speed.
my participation in the collapse of communism is a different
story which has to be told in a different place. in fact, i have already
written two books on the subject, gyersing ihtl soviei syslsiem in 1930,
and underwriting democracy in 1991. the point that needs to be
made here is that i was guided by exactly the same philosophy in
my philanthropic activities in eastern europe as in the financial
markets. as the reader will learn, i treat developments in financial
markets as a historical process. that makes my theory eminently
applicable to a histyical process such as the collapse of commu-
nism. i did apply my theory and on the whole it enabled me to an-
ticipate events better than most people. as i discovered, there is a
great deal of similarity between a boom-bust process in the finan-
cial ma&kets and the rise and fall of the soviet system.
it is ironic that i b'ecame famous, not because of my activities in
eastern europe, but because of the profit we made on sterling when
britain left the exchange rate mechanism on seember 16,1992. i
became an instant celebrity, first in britain, then in the rest of the
world. when it became known that the quantum group of funds
had bought a large block of newmont mines, the price of gold
soared. although i expressed no opinion gold, ail itil3ds ur' opin-
or.
ions were attributed to me. i made some attempts to rebut them,
but to no avail. although i had not sought guru status, i could not
ignore it when it was thrust upon me. in fact, i welcomed it because
i thought that it would be useful in having my voice heard on polit-
ical issues. but that was not as simple as it seemed. when i said that
the bundesbank's high interest rate policy was becoming counter-
productive, the markets responded by pushing down the german
mark. but when i inveighed against european policy on bosnia, i
was either ignored or told to stick to the field of my expertise. i
fared particularly poorly in france, where i refrained from specu-
lating against the franc because i did not want to be responsible for
the collapse of what remained of the european exchange rate

6 preface
mechanism, but i was blamed for it anyhow. the french govern-
i ment resented my advice even more than it would have resented
my speculative activities. it goes to show that speculators ought to
speculate and keep their mouths shut.
my notoriety as a financial guru has created a tremendous de-
mand for the alchemy of finance, hence this new edition. i must con-
fess that my thinking has evolved a great deal since i wrote this
book, but i have been concerned mainly with historical processes,
not with financial ones. i cannot summarize my ideas in this pref-
ace-i need to write another book. i intend to do so as soon as time
permits, but there is one important theoretical point i need to make
in urcler iu llir~g i i t i ~
book in line with my curr6nt thirtkmng.
in the alchemy of finance, i put forward the theory of reflexivity
i as if it were relevant at all times. that is true in the sense that the
two-way feedback mechanism that is the hallmark of reflexivity
can come into play at any time, but it is not true in the sense that
it is at play at all times. in fact, in most situations it is so feeble
that it can be safely ignored. we may distinguish between near-
equilibrium conditions where certain corrective mechanisms pre-
vent perceptions and reality from drifting too far apart, and
far-from-equilibrium conditions where a reflexive double-feedback
mechanism is at work and there is no tendency for perceptions and
reality to come close together without a significant change in the
prevailing conditions, a change of regime. in the first case, classical
economic theory applies and the divergence between perceptions
and reality can be ignored as mere noise. in the second case, the
theory. of equilibrium becomes irrelevant and we are confronted
with a one-directional historical process where changes in both
yerceptims and reslity a x irreversible. it is important to distin- , ,
guish between these two different states of affairs because what is
normal in one is abnormal in the other
the idea of a distinction between nea rium and far-from-
equilibrium conditions is present in the alchemy of finance. at the
end of chapter 1, i distinguish between humdrum and historical
change but i understate the importance of the distinction. i call it
"tautological." i now consider this a mistake. the tautology arises
only because i do not probe deeply enough and cover up with a tau-
tology what is a fundamental difference in the structure of events.
in most phenomena investigated by scientific method, one set
of conditions follows another irrespective of what anybody thinks
about them. the phenomena studied by social sciences, which

preface 7
include the finan~ial~markets, have thinking participants and this
complicates matters. as i have tried to show, the participants' views
are inherently biased. instead of a direct line leading from one set of
conditions to the n e ~ t one, there is a constant criss-crossing be-
tween the objective, abservable conditions and the participant's ob-
servations and vice &sa: participants base their decisions not on
objective conditions but on their interpretation of those conditions.
this is an important point and it has far-reaching consequences. it
introduces an element of indeterminacy which renders the subject
matter less amenable to the kind of generalizations, predictions,
and explanations that have given natural science its reputation. ex-
actly because it is so disruptive; the social sciztnces in general and
economic theory in particular have done their best to eliminate or
to ignore the element of indeterminacy. i have taken issue with that
endeavor and tried to develop an alternative approach which takes
the participants' bias:as its starting point.
in retrospect, i may have overstated my case. there are many sit-
uations that can be fruitfully studied by taking the participants'
bias as given and ignoring the element of indeterminacy which it
may generate. it is only in certain respects and in certain special
circumstances that the indeterminacy becomes significant. it comes
into play when expectations about the future have a bearing on
present behavior-which is the case in financial markets. but even
there, some mechanism must be triggered for the participants' bias
to affect not only market prices but the so-called fundamentals
which are supposed to determine market prices. apparently 1 have
failed tokake this sufficiently clear. the message of my boo
is usually summed up by saying that the participants' value judg-
ments are always biased and the prevailing bias aifects narket
prices. if that is all i had to say it would be hardly worth writing a
book about it. my point is that there are occasions when the bias
affects not only market prices but also the so-called fundamentals.
this is when reflexivity becomes important. it does not happen all
the time but when it does, market prices follow a different pattern.
they also play a different role: they do not merely reflect the
so-called fundamentals; they themselves become one of the funda-
mentals which shape the evolution of prices. this recursive rela-
tionship renders the evolution of prices indeterminate and the
so-called equilibrium price irrelevant.
nobody would deny that individual participants operate with bi-
ased views; but the prevailing wisdom holds that the participants'

8 preface
-w- bias can be dismissed as temporary aberrations, so-called random
walks. that is the point on which i disagree. i now believe this
point can be more effectively made by drawing a distinction be-
tween near-equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium conditions than
by proposing a general theory of history based on the constant
cross-crossing between perceptions and reality as i have done in
the alchemy of finance. that does not mean that there is anything
wrong with the general theory; it means only that the concept of
reflexivity becomes more significant if it is reserved for those cases
where the double feedback mechanism is actually at work.
the alchemy of finance is devoted to the study of such cases. the
a s s t c??vious exam.ple is equity lewragirtg where a temporary
overvaluation of shares is converted into per-share earnings
4 through the issue of shares at inflated prices. in most of the cases
discussed, the participants' bias involves an actual error in their
thinking. for instance, in the late 1970s international bankers lent
too much money to developing countries because they failed to
recognize that the so-called debt ratios they used to measure the
creditworthiness of the borrowing countries were reflexive in the
sense that they were affected by their own lending activity. but
it is not necessary for the bias to involve an actual error. as i show
in chapter 3, a freely fluctuating exchange rate system is inher-
ently unstable because of the influence of trend-following specu-
lation, yet speculators follow the correct strategy by following the
trend.
judging by the public reaction-which consists mainly of com-
ments by journalists who read the book superficially or not at all-
i have not been successful in demonstrating the significance of
reflexivity. only the iirst part of my argument-that the prevailing
bias affects market prices-seems to have registered. the second
part-that the prevailing bias can in certain circumstances also af-
fect the so-called fundamentals and changes in market prices cause
changes in market prices-seems to have gone unnoticed.
the fault is at least partially mine. since reflexivity changes the
structure of events, i have tried to put forward a reflexive structure
as the universally valid way of looking at the evolution of market
prices-a kind of general theory h la keynes in which the absence
of reflexivity constitutes a special case. it would have been better
to present reflexivity as the special case because what endows re-
flexivity with significance is the fact that it operates intermittently.

preface 9
once the significance of reflexivity has sunk in and the inadequacy
of the prevailing wisdom has been recognized, the time would have
been ripe for proposing a general theory of reflexivity.
i have my excuses. i did not observe reflexivity in financial mar-
kets but developed reflexivity as an abstract philosophical concept
before i entered the financial markets. in other words, i failed as a
philosophical speculptor before i succeeded as a financial one. ap-
parently, my failure as a philosopher carried over into my book be-
cause i did not make the concept of reflexivity-which can be
observed and converted into profit-as clear as it could be. when
one discovers something new, one has an understandable inclina-
aon to exaggerate it$ importance. this is what i did with reiiexiv-
ity. by proposing a general theory of reflexivity, i may have gone
too far too soon. i claimed that economic theory is false and social
science is a false metaphor. these are exaggerated claims. since far-
from-equilibrium conditions arise only intermittently, economic
theory is only intermittently false. and the dividing line between
natural and social sqience is not quite as hard and fast as i made it
appear when i wrote the book. these qualifications render reflexiv-
ity more rather than less significant.
once the concept of reflexivity is established, the range of its ap-
plicability seems to widen. it is possible to treat the evolution of
prices in all financial markets taken together as a reflexive, histori-
cal process. i have done so in the alchemy of finance when i ana-
lyzed reagan's "imperial circle," and i have found other examples
since the book was published, such as the german imperial circle
after the fall of the berlin wall. (see appendix: "the prospect of eu-
ropean disintegration.") but there is a danger in pushing the con-
cept oi reflexivity too far, as i nave learned at my owri expefiac.
there are lohg fallow periods when the movements in financial
markets do not seem to follow a reflexive tune but rather resemble
the random walks mandated by the efficient market theory. in
these circumstances, it is better to do nothing than to pursue a re-
f lexive hypothesis.
treating reflexivity as an intermittent phenomenon rather than
as a universally valid condition opens up fertile fields for investiga-
tion. for instance, the question poses itself: how can near- and far-
from-equilibrium conditions be distinguished from each other?
what is the criterion of demarcation? i have done a lot of thinking
on that question and i have the beginnings of an answer. whether

10 preface
i can formulate it properly remains to be seen in my next book. it
4 revolves around a question of values and it is relevant for society in
general, not only for financial markets. my next book, if it is ever
written, will be a theory of history, not a theory of finance. i am
providing an example of how the boom-bust pattern of financial
markets can be applied to larger historical processes in the ap-
pendix where i reproduce a lecture i delivered on september 29,
1993, entitled "prospect for european disintegration."

introduction

in a very real sense, this book is my life's work. it touches on
many of my most abiding interests and it brings together the two
main strands in my 'intellectual development: one abstract and
one practical.
the abstract came' first. ever since i became conscious of my
existence i have had a passionate interest in understanding it, and
1 regarded my own 'understanding as the central problem that
needed to be understood. to understand oneself-gnote aucton;
nosce te ipsum-is an impossible task. to achiwe-anythingsl_
sembling knowledge we must be abj~i~-draw a d@in-cti-onebe-
- -- --- --
v- - --
tween subject and object; yet in this case the two are the same.
~ h d - o n e ihinks is part3 what one thinks about; therefore, one's
thinking lacks an independent pint of referexce by -,=.hich it can
be judged-it lacks objectivity.
as an undergraduate i studied economics, but i found eco-
nomic theory highly unsatisfactory because it failed to come to
grips with th$problem; indeed, it went through great contortions
to avoid it. economics seeks to be a science. science is supposed
to be objective and it is difficult to be scientific when the subject
matter, the participant in the economic process, lacks objectivity.
i was greatly influenced at the time by karl popper's ideas on
scientific method. i accepted most of his views, with one major
exception. he argued in favor of what he called "unity of
methodh1-that is, the methods and criteria that apply to the
study of natural phenomena also apply to the study of social
events. i felt that there was a fundamental difference between the

12 introduction
two: the events studied by the social sciences have thinking par-
t ticipants; natural phenomena do not. the participants' thinking
creates problems that have no counterpart in natural science. the
closest analogy is in quantum physics, where scientific observa-
tion gives rise to heisenberg's uncertainty principle; but in social
events it is the participants' thinking that is responsible for the
element of uncertainty, not the outside observer.
natural science studies events that consist of a sequence of
facts. when events have thinking participants, the subject matter
is no longer confined to facts but also includes the participants'
perceptions. the chain of causation does not lead directly from
fact to fact but from fact to perception and from perception to fact.
this would not create any insuperable difficulties if there were
i some kind of correspondence or equivalence between facts and
perceptions. unfortunately, that is impossible because the partic-
ipants' perceptions do not relate to facts, but to a situation that is
contingent on their own perceptions and therefore cannot be
treated as a fact.
economic theory tries to sidestep the issue by introducing the
assumption of rational behavior. people are assumed to act by
choosing the best of the available alternatives, but somehow the
distinction between perceived alternatives and facts is assumed
away. the result is a theoretical construction of great elegance
that resembles natural science but does not resemble reality. it
relates to an ideal world in which participants act on the basis of
perfect knowledge and it produces a theoretical equilibrium in
which the allocation of resources is at an optimum. it has little
relevance to the real world in which people act on the basis of
imperfect understanding and equilibrium is beyond rea~h.
the relationship between the participants' understanding and
the situation in which they participate continued to preoccupy
me long after i left college. my first priority was to try and make a
living but in my spare time i wrote a philosophical treatise on the
subject with the catchy title "the burden of consciousness." un-
fortunately, the title was the best part of it. by the time i finished,
i disagreed with my own presentation. i spent three years revising
it. one day i reread what i had written the day before and i could
not make head or tail of it. it made me realize that i had reached
a dead end, and i decided to give it up. that was when the prac-
tical streak in me began to dominate my intellectual development.
if i had to sum up my practical skills, i would use one word:
survival. when i was an adolescent, the second world war gave

introduction 13
me a lesson that i have never forgotten. i was fortunate enough to
have a father who was highly skilled in the art of survival, having
lived through the russian revolution as an escaped prisoner of
war. under his tutelgge the second world war served as an ad-
vanced course at a tender age. as the reader shall see, the invest-
ment vehicle i created a quarter of a century later drew heavily on
skills i learned as an ;adolescent.
after leaving college i had a number of false starts and finally
became an international arbitrage trader in stocks, first in london
and then in new york. when the european common market was
formed in 1957, american investors became interested in euro-
pean shares, 1 became a security analyst r;bsiaisg aiiuc~icrnn iirsti-
tutions on their european investments and for a brief period i
ruled as a one-eyed king among the blind. my glory came to an
abrupt end when president kennedy introduced a so-called inter-
est equalization tax which effectively stopped purchases of for-
eign securities. i decided to put my money-making activities on
the back burner and spent three years, from 1963 to 1966, revising
"the burden of consciousness."
when i finally decided to return to the land of the living i
started a model portfolio that became a hedge fund (a mutual fund
that employs leverage and uses various techniques of hedging) in
1969. i have been in charge of that fund ever since, although i
delegated much of the responsibility to others between september
1981 and september 1984. the fund has g r o w h o m about $4
million at inception to nearly $2 billion and most of the growth
has been internally generated. original investors have seen the
value of their shares mulitiply 300-fold. no investment fund has
ever prodsced comparable results,
in the first ten years of my business career i had not much use
for anything i had learned in college and there was an almost total
separation between my practical activities and my theoretical in-
terests. selling and trading in securities was a game i played with-
out putting my true self on the line.
all this changed when i became a fund manager. i was putting
my money where my mouth was and i could not afford to disso-
ciate myself from my investment decisions. i had to use all my
intellectual rasources and i discovered, to my great surprise and
gratification, that my abstract ideas came in very handy. it would
be an exaggeration to say that they accounted for my success; but
there can be no doubt that they gave me an edge.
i developed my own peculiar approach to investing, which was

14 introduction
' at loggerheads with the prevailing wisdom. the generally ac- .
cepted view is that markets are always right-that is, market
prices tend to discount future developments accurately even
when it is unclear what those developments are. i start with the
opposite point of view. i believe that market prices are always
wrong in the sense that they present a biased view of the future.
but distortion works in both directions: not only do market par-
ticipants operate with a bias, but their bias can also influence the
course of events. this may create the impression that markets
anticipate future developments accurately, but in fact it is not
present expectations that correspond to future events but future
ents that are sha~ed by prose~t expect~?fons. the psrticipants' t
rceptions are inherently flawed, and there is a two-way connec-
i tion between flawed perceptions and the actual course of events,
which results in a lack of correspondence between the two. i call
this two-way connection "reflexivity."
in the course of my investment activities, i discovered that fi-
nancial markets operate on a principle that is somehow akin to
scientific method. making an investment decision is like formu-
lating a scientific hypothesis and submitting it to a practical test.
the main difference is that the hypothesis that underlies an in-
vestment decision is intended to make money and not to establish
a universally valid generalization. both activities involve signifi-
cant risk, and success brings a corresponding reward-monetary
in one case and scientific in the other. taking this view, it is
possible to see financial markets as a laboratory for testing hy-
potheses, albeit not strictly scientific ones. the truth is, success-
ful investing is a kind of alchemy.
most market participants do zot view ~ll,arketb iii this ligc:. that
means that they do not know what hypotheses are being tested; it
also means that most of the hypotheses that are submitted to mar-
ket testing are quite banal. usually they amount to nothing more
than the assertion that a particular stock is going to outperform
the market averages.
i had a certain advantage over other investors because at least i
had an idea about the way financial markets operate. i would be
lying, however, if i claimed that i could always formulate worth-
while hypotheses on the basis of my theoretical framework.
sometimes there were no reflexive processes to be found; some-
times i failed to find them; and, what was the most painful of all,
sometimes i got them wrong. one way or another, i often invested

without a worthwhile hypothesis and my activities were not very
different from a random walk. but i was attuned to reflexive pro-
cesses in financial markets and my major successes came from
exploiting the opportunities they presented.
my approach to the market was not as abstract as it sounds. it
took an intensely parsonal, emotional form: testing was closely
associated with pain ;and success with relief. when i asserted that
"markets are always biased" i was giving expression to a deeply
felt attitude: i had a very low regard for the sagacity of profes-
sional investors and the more influential their position the less i
considered them capable of making the right decisions. my part-
ner and 1 taoltl ;
malielous plsasure in makhg rnoriey by selling
short stocks that were institutional favorites. but we differed in
our attitudes to our own activities. he regarded only the other
participants' views as flawed, while i thought that we had as good
a chance of being wrong as anyone else. the assumption of inher-
ently flawed perceptions suited my self-critical attitude.
operating a hedge ;fund utilized my training in survival to the
fullest. using leverage can produce superior results when the
going is good, but it can wipe you out when events fail to conform
to your expectations: one of the hardest things to judge is what
level of risk is safe. there are no universally valid yardsticks: each
situation needs to be judged on its own merit. in the final analysis
you must rely on your instincts for survival. thus my engagement
in running a hedge fund brought together both my abstract inter-
ests and my practical skills.
i did not play the financial markets according to a particular set
of rules; i was always more interested in understanding the
changes that cccur in the rules of the game. i started with hy-
potheses relating to individual companies; with the passage of
time my interests veered increasingly toward macroeconomic
themes. this was due partly to the growth of the fund and partly
to the growing instability of the macroeconomic environment. for
instance, exchange rates were fixed until subsequently, they
1973;
became a fertile field for speculation.
for the past four or five years i have had a growing sense of
impending financial disaster. i felt that a long-lasting expansion-
ary cycle was becoming increasingly unsound and unsustainable
and we were getting ready for a bust. that was one of the reasons
i distanced myself from the active management of the fund in
1981 and reduced its overalflevel of exposure. my interest shifted

16 introduction
from my own survival to the survival of the system. i made a
i study of the international debt problem and published some pa-
pers on the subject. i used the same theoretical framework as in
my investment activities and my analysis was not without merit.
unfortunately, the more complex the system, the greater the room
for error. i made some mistakes in my analysis that detracted from
the accuracy of my predictions; they also had a detrimental effect
on my investment results until i revised my views in the course
of writing this book.
the more successful i had been in applying my ideas in finan-
cial markets, the keener i became to express them in theoretical
form. i ~ u ~ ~ t i i m e d t ~ i ~eeikh the iarrtasy that the concept of ref"lr;x-
ivity constitutes a major contribution to our understanding of the
4 world in which we live. i believed that the participants' bias is
the key to an understanding of all historical processes that have
thinking participants, just as genetic mutation is the key to biolog-
ical evolution. but a satisfactory formulation of the theory of re-
flexivity continued to elude me. i always ran into trouble when i
tried to define what i meant by the imperfect understanding of the
participants. to speak accurately of a distortion we must know
what the situation would be if it were not distorted by the partic-
ipants' perceptions. unfortunately that does not seem possible
because the participants' thinking is an integral part of the situa-
tion they have to think about. it is not surprising that the concept
of reflexivity should present extreme difficulties; if it were an
easier concept to work with, economists and other social scien-
tists would not have gone to such lengths to banish it from their
subject matter.
this book is a finel. attempt to expiore the i~~iplications of re-
flexivity. i have tried to circumvent the difficulties i encountered
in the past by approaching the subject from the opposite direc-
tion. instead of getting bogged down in abstract theory, i am going
to draw on my experimental, practical findings to the greatest
possible extent. i cannot avoid an abstract discussion altogether,
but i have confined it to a single chapter. in exploring the practi-
cal implications, i start with the simplest cases and gradually lead
up to more complex ones. this approach happens to coincide
with the historical order in which 1 encountered reflexive devel-
opments in practice: first the stock market, then the currency mar-
ket, then the international debt problem, and finally what may be
called the credit cycle.

introduction 17
the stock market provides some pure examples of a boom and
bust pattern; freely floating currency rates allow me to explore
well-formed wave patterns. the boom and bust in international
bank lending is part pf a more complex, historical process of
credit expansion and eventual credit contraction. it has given rise
to the configuration that i have dubbed "reagan's imperial cir-
cle." the configuratioq prevailed from the international debt cri-
sis of 1982 until the first half of 1985 but it was inherently
unstable. how the instability will be resolved is one of the main
questions considered in this book.
the experimental approach has borne unexpected results. i
mads two major discavsries in the courss of writiiig: one is a i
reflexive connection between credit and collateral; the other is a
reflexive relationship between the regulators and the economy
they regulate.
it has long been asshmed that monetary values are a passive
reflection of the state of affairs in the real world. classical eco-
nomics focused on the real world and neglected the problems
connected with money and credit; even keynes couched his gen-
eral theory in real terms. monetarists sought to stand the relation-
ship on its head: they kgue that it is possible to control inflation
by controlling the growth of the money supply.
in my opinion, all 'these views are based on a fundamental
misconception. money values do not simply mirror the state of
affairs in the real world; valuation is a positive actqhat makes an
impact on the course of events. monetary and real phenomena are
connected in a reflexive fashion; that is, they influence each other
mutually. the reflexive relationship manifests itself most clearly
ir, the use ~ n abuse d ol credit.
loans are based on the lender's estimation of the borrower's
ability to service his debt. the valuation of the collateral is sup-
posed to be independent of the act of lending; but in actual fact
the act of lending can affect the value of the collateral. this is true
of the individual case and of the economy as a whole. credit
expansion stimulates the economy and enhances collateral val-
ues; the repayment or contraction of credit has a depressing influ-
ence both on the economy and on the valuation of the collateral.
the connection between credit and economic activity is anything
but constant-for instance, credit for building a new factory has
quite a different effect from credit for a leveraged buyout. this
makes it difficult to quantify t& connection between credit and

18 introduction
economic activity. yet it is a mistake to ignore it. the monetarist
4 school has done so, with disastrous consequences.
the reflexive interaction between the act of lending and collat-
eral values has led me to postulate a pattern in which a period of
gradual, slowly accelerating credit expansion is followed by a
short period of credit contraction-the classic sequence of boom
and bust. the bust is compressed in time because the attempt to
liquidate loans causes a sudden implosion of collateral values.
economic history has been punctuated by booms and busts.
nevertheless, the concept of a credit cycle is too simplistic to
explain the course of events. for one thing, the connection be-
!wee~ credit and sson~mic activity is too tenuous and variable to
yield a regular pattern. for another, the sequence of events is
i greatly complicated by the influence of economic policy. periodic
busts have been so devastating that strenuous efforts have been
made to prevent them. these efforts have led to the evolution of
central banking and of other mechanisms for controlling credit
and regulating economic activity.
to understand the role of the regulators it must be realized that
they are also participants: their understanding is inherently im-
perfect and their actions have unintended consequences. the re-
lationship between the regulators and the economy is reflexive
and it also exhibits cyclical characteristics in the sense that it
tends to swing from one extreme to another.
what is the connection between the regulatory cycle and the
credit cycle? at this point, my views become very tentative. i
believe that the two cycles broadly overlap in time, that the min-
imum of regulations tends to coincide with the maximum of
credit expansion and v i ~ e versa. but within this chronological
coincidence there is constant interaction between the two cycles
that influences the shape and duration of both. the interaction
between the two cycles yields a unique path that cannot be fitted
into any regular or repetitive pattern.
i have tried to apply this complex and tentative framework to
an interpretation of recent economic and financial history. need-
less to say, a great many factors come into play; but my focus is
on the twin cycles in credit and regulation. the main topics i deal
with are the transformation of banking from a highly regulated to
a less regulated industry, the boom and bust in international lend-
ing, mergermania, and international capital movements.
until 1982, the story is a fairly straightforward case of boom

introduction 19
and bust, but after 1982 the situation gets very complicated. if
events had been allo&d to take their course, the uncontrolled
credit expansion of the 1970s would have come to an unhappy
end; but exactly becauae the consequences would have been so
disastrous, the financial authorities came to the rescue and suc-
cessfully avoided a bust. since then, we have been passing
through uncharted waters. the great boom exhausted itself some
time ago but its life span has been extended by artificial means in
order to avoid a great bust.
i try to trace the unique path that events have taken: the pres-
ervation of the accumulated burden of bad international debt
through the formation c f what i call the "collective" system of
lending and the emergence of the united states government as
the "borrower of last resort." both of these are unprecedented
developments. they gave rise to this strange constellation that i
have called the imperial circle: a benign circle at the center and a
vicious circle at the periphery of a worldwide system based on a
strong dollar, a strong ;us. economy, a growing budget deficit,
a growing trade deficit, and high real interest rates. the imperial
circle held the international economic and financial system to-
gether but it was inherently unstable because the strong dollar
and high real interest rates were bound to outweigh the stimulat-
ing effect of the budget deficit and weaken the u.s. economy. the
imperial circle could not last indefinitely. what would happen
next? x
to answer that question, i conducted an experiment from au-
gust 1985 onward. in effect, i kept a diary in which i recorded the
thoughts that went into my investment decisions on a real-time
hsis. since i c~nsidered the future of the imperial circle of park-
mount importance, the experiment served as a test of my ability
to predict the future course of events, using the framework devel-
oped in the book. the experiment was a roaring success in finan-
cial terms-my fund never did better. it also produced a
surprising result: i came out of the experiment with quite differ-
ent expectations about the future.
i started with the presumption that the benign circle was in
danger of reversing itself: a weak dollar and a weak economy
would combine to keep interest rates higher than they ought to
be, and without any scope for further monetary or fiscal stimulus
the decline of both the economy and the dollar would become
irreversible. but the situation was once again saved by the inter-
\

2 0 introduction
vention of the monetary authorities. by changing from a system
+ of freely floating exchange rates to a "dirty float," the decline of
the dollar was cushioned, and, with the help of lower interest
rates and booming financial markets, the economy was prevented
from slipping into recession. we entered a new phase which i
describe, with only a modicum of irony, as the "golden age of
capitalism."
it can be seen that this book seeks to accomplish a number of
things at the same time. it propounds not just one general theory
-the theory of reflexivity-but also another specific theory, that
of a credit-cum-regulatory cycle. the latter idea is so tentative
that it hardly qualifies as a theory. yet i try != apijly it zot ~ a l to y
explain contemporary history but also to predict the outcome,
t and in the course of doing so i provide a practical demonstration
of the fundamental difference between explaining and predicting
reflexive phenomena. i also try to draw some general conclusions
from the analysis. the most important ones are, first, that it is
credit that matters, not money (in other words, monetarism is a
false ideology), and, second, that the concept of a general equilib-
rium has no relevance to the real world (in other words, classical
economics is an exercise in futility). financial markets are inher-
ently unstable; that leads to a third conclusion that is better stated
as a question than an assertion: what policy measures are needed
to reestablish the stability of our economic system?
the book would be easier to read if it tried to make just one
point at a time. unfortunately, that is not possible, because the
various points are interconnected. if the theory of reflexivity were
widely known, i could have taken it for granted and concentrated
on an exploration of +&e credit and regulat~ry cycles. si~~iiarly, if
the fact that financial markets are inherently unstable were gen-
erally recognized, i need not have spent so much time on dem-
onstrating that the concept of equilibrium as used in economic
theory is totally unrealistic. as it is, i had to try to make several
points more or less simultaneously.
to make matters worse, the book does not qualify as a finished
product. when i started writing it, i thought i had a theory of
reflexivity to present and my difficulties related only to its presen-
tation. as i tried to apply the theory to various situations, i dis-
covered that i do not actually have a well-formed theory. the idea
that the participants' biases play an important causal role in his-
torical events is both valid and interesting, but it is too general to

introduction 21
qualify as a theory that can help to explain and predict the course
of events. the boomhust pattern i have established applies to
some developments but not to others. to try to fit every initially
self-reinforcing and eyentually self-defeating development into
its mold can give rise, to serious distortions. i feel like the early
astronomers who tried to describe the elliptical paths of the
planets in terms of circles and semicircles; the only difference is
that the path of reflexibe events is irregular to start with.
my fantasy was to present a general theory of reflexivity that
would explain the great bust of the 1980s in the same way that
keynes's general theory of employment, interest and money ex-
plained the great depression sf ihz 1330s. as it tr;rns or;:, wa do
not have a great bust and i do not have a general theory. what i
have is an approach that can help to illuminate the present pre-
carious state of our financial system. it cannot explain and predict
the course of events in the manner to which we have become
accustomed during our long love affair with natural science for
the simple reason that reflexive processes cannot be explained
and predicted in that aanner. a different approach is needed and
this book is an attempt to develop one. it is best regarded as part
of a process of discoveky rather than the finished product.
all this makes for a difficult, dense book, although i can prom-
ise the reader that nothing in the rest of the book is quite as dense
as this introduction. i explore a complex subject. i bring a com-
plex mind to bear on it. i can argue in my defensethat the com-
plexity of my thinking mirrors the complexity of the financial
markets rather well, as demonstrated by the financial outcome
of the real-time experiment. there is, therefore, at least a prima
facie case fcrr giving me 3 hearicg. i shall t-ry ncii to abuse the pdv-
ilege.
it may be helpful if i sketch out the structure of the book. part i
propounds the theory, the first chapter deals with the concept of
reflexivity in general terms and explores the difficulties in under-
standing reflexive phenomena. in particular, it argues that the
symmetry between explanation and prediction that characterizes
the laws of natural science is not attainable. the next three chap-
ters apply the theory to the financial markets: chapter 2 to the
stock market and chapter 3 to the currency market, with chapter
4 outlining a credit and regulatory cycle.
part i1 seeks to explain contemporary economic and financial
history using the hypotheses outlined in chapter 4. the history

2 2 introduction
is, of necessity, selective, concentrating on those developments
4 that are relevant to the concept of a credit and regulatory cycle.
my main topics are banking, international lending, and merger-
mania.
part i11 consists of a real-time experiment which is both test and
prediction at the same time. as a test it does not qualify as a
scientific one by the standards of natural science; but it may serve
as an example of how theories about reflexive developments can
be tested.
part iv evaluates the results of the real-time experiment. chap-
ter 15 explores the scope for what i provocatively call alchemy.

ence.
t part v seeks to provide some prescriptions for economic policy.
chapter examines the relative merits of free markets and regu-

lation, and chapter 18 argues in favor of an international central
bank. since both the market mechanism and the attempts to reg-
ulate it are inherently flawed, it may be argued that all attempts
at systemic reform are doomed to failure. i reject that argument in
chapter 19.
in the epilogue i explore the implications of the concept of
reflexivity outside the sphere of finance and in a final flight of
fancy i attempt to provide my own answers to some age-old meta-
physical questions.
since my thinking has evolved in the course of writing, it may
be helpful for the reader to know when the various chapters were
written. the first part of the book was completed before i em-
barked on the real-time experiment in, aug~st 1985. mcreovei,
chapters 5-9, which deal with recent history, preceded in time
chapter 4, which outlines the concept of the credit and regulatory
cycle. chapter 4 incorporates discoveries i made in the course of
writing; that is why it is so tentative in character.

i should like to emphasize that this book is not meant to pro-
vide a practical guide to getting rich in the stock market. most of
what 1 know is in the book, at least in theoretical form. i have not
kept anything deliberately hidden. but the chain of reasoning
operates in the opposite direction: i am not trying to explain how
to use my approach to make money; rather, i am using my expe-
riences in the financial markets to develop an approach to the

study of historical processes in general and the present historical
moment in particulai. if i did not believe that my investment
activities can serve that purpose, i would not want to write about
them. as long as i am actively engaged in business, i would be
better off to keep theq a trade secret. but i would value it much
more highly than any'business success if i could contribute to an
understanding of the~world in which we live or, better yet, if i
could help to preserve the economic and political system that has
allowed me to flourish as a participant.

the theory of reflexivity

economic theory is devoted to the study of equilibrium positions.
the concept of an equilibrium is very useful. it allows us to focus
on the final outcome rather than on the process that leads up to
it. but the concept is also very deceptive. it has the aura of some-
thing empirical: since the adjustment process is supposed to lead
to an equilibrium, an equilibrium position seems somehow im-
plicit in our observations. that is not true. equilibrium itself has
rarely been observed in real life-market prices hwe a notorious
habit of fluctuating. the process that can be observed is supposed
to move toward an equilibrium. why is it that the equilibrium is
never reached? it is true that market participants adjust to market
prices llit they may be adjusting to a constaxitly moving talgei. in
that case, calling the participants' behavior an adjustment process
may be a misnomer and equilibrium theory becomes irrelevant to
the real world.
equilibrium is the product of an axiomatic system. economic
theory is constructed like logic or mathematics: it is based on
certain postulates and all of its conclusions are derived from them
by logical manipulation. the possibility that equilibrium is never
reached need not invalidate the logical construction, but when a
hypothetical equilibrium is presented as a model of reality a sig-
nificant distortion is introduced. if we lived in a world in which
the angles of a triangle did not add up to 180 degrees, euclidean
geometry would constitute such a misleading model.

28 theory
the crowning achievement of the axiomatic approach is the
theory of perfect cgmpetition. although it was first propounded
nearly two hundred years ago, it has never been superseded; only
the method of analysis has been refined. the theory holds that
under certain specified circumstances the unrestrained pursuit of
self-interest leads 40 the optimum allocation of resources. the
equilibrium point is reached when each firm produces at a level
where its margina1;cost equals the market price and each con-
sumer buys an amount whose marginal "utility" equals the mar-
ket price. analysis shows that the equilibrium position
maximizes the benefit of all participants, provided no individual
buyer or seller can ihfluence market prices. it is this line of argu-
ment thaihas served as the theoretical underpinning for the lais-
sez-faire policies of the nineteenth century, and it is also the basis
of the current belief in the "magic of the marketplace."
let us examine the main assumptions of the theory of perfect
competition. those that are spelled out include perfect knowl-
edge; homogeneous ,and divisible products; and a large enough
number of participarjts so that no single participant can influence
the market price.
the assumption of perfect knowledge is suspect because under-
standing a situation in which one participates cannot qualify as
knowledge. that was the assumption that i found so unacceptable
as a student. i have lo doubt that classical economists used the
assumption in exactly that sense in which i found it objectionable
because nineteenth-century thinkers were less aware of the limi-
tations of knowledge than we are today. as the epistemological
problems began to surface, exponents of the theory found that
they could get by using a more modest word: inforrrlction. in its
modern formulation the theory merely postulates perfect infor-
mation.'
unfortunately, this assumption is not quite sufficient to support
the construction of the theory. to make up for the deficiency,
modern economists resorted to an ingenious device: they insisted
that the demand and supply curves should be taken as given.
they did not present this as a postulate; rather, they based their
claim on methodological grounds. they argued that the task of
economics is to study the relationship between supply and de-
mand and not either by itself. demand may be a suitable subject
for psychologists, supply may be the province of engineers or
management scientists; both are beyond the scope of  economic^.^
therefore, both must be taken as given.

the theory of reflexivity 29
yet, if we stop to ask what it means that the conditions of
i supply and demand are independently given, it is clear that an
additional assumption has been introduced. otherwise, where
would those curves come from? we are dealing with an as-
sumption disguised as a methodological device. participants
are supposed to choose between alternatives in accordance
with their scale of preferences. the unspoken assumption is that
the participants know what those preferences and alternatives
are.
as i shall try to show, this assumption is untenable. the shape
of the supply and demand curves cannot be taken as indepen-
dently given, because both of them incorporate the participants'
expectations about events that are shaped by their own expecta-
tions.
i nowhere is the role of expectations more clearly visible than in
financial markets. buy and sell decisions are based on expecta-
tions about future prices, and future prices, in turn, are contingent
on present buy and sell decisions. to speak of supply and de-
mand as if they were determined by forces that are independent
of the market participants' expectations is quite misleading. the
situation is not quite so clear-cut in the case of commodities,
where supply is largely dependent on production and demand on
consumption. but the price that determines the amounts pro-
duced and consumed is not necessarily the present price. on the
contrary, market participants are more likely to be guided by fu-
ture prices, either as expressed in futures marketg or as antici-
pated by themselves. in either case, it is inappropriate to speak of
independently given supply and demand curves because both
curves incorporate the participants' expectations about future
prices.
the very idea that events in the marketplace may affect the
shape of the demand and supply curves seems incongruous to
those who have been reared on classical economics. the demand
and supply curves are supposed to determine the market price. if
they were themselves subject to market influences, prices would
cease to be uniquely determined. instead of equilibrium, we
would be left with fluctuating prices. this would be a devastating
state of affairs. all the conclusions of economic theory would lose
their relevance to the real world.
it is to prevent this outcome that the methodological device that
treats the supply and demand curves as independently given was
introduced. yet there is something insidious about using a meth-

30 theory
odological device to obscure an assumption that would be unten-
able if it were spelled out. to preserve the integrity of economic
theory as an axiomatic system, its assumptions ought to be ex-
plicitly stated. we may then conclude that economic theory is no
more relevant to the real world than non-euclidean geometry, but
at least we would know where we stand. instead, we have been
deceived by a methodological subterfuge. the demand and sup-
ply curves are prpsented in textbooks as though they were
grounded in empirical evidence. but there is scant evidence for
independently given demand and supply curves. anyone who
trades in markets where prices are continuously changing knows
that participants are very much influenced by market develop-
ments. rising prices ~jfteil ditraci buyers and vice versa. how
could self-reinforcing trends persist if supply and demand curves
were independent of market prices? yet, even a cursory look at
commodity, stock, and currency markets confirms that trends are
the rule rather than )he exception.
the theory of perfect competition could be defended by arguing
that the trends we can observe in commodity and financial mar-
kets are merely temporary aberrations which will be eliminated
in the long run by the "fundamental" forces of supply and de-
mand. it should be remembered that the theory of perfect compe-
tition does not claim to define the path of adjustment; it merely
analyzes the situation after all the adjustments have taken place.
the trouble with the argument is that there can be no assurance
that "fundamental" forces will correct "speculative" excesses. it
is just as possible that speculation will alter the supposedly fun-
damental conditions of supply and demand.
in the normal course of events, a speculative price rise provokes
countervailing forcss: suppiy is increased and demand reduced,
and the temporary excess is corrected with the passage of time.
but there are exceptions. in foreign exchange, for example, a sus-
tained price movement can be self-validating, because of its im-
pact on domestic price levels. the same is true in the stock market
where the performance of a stock may affect the performance of
the company in question in a number of ways. and in examining
the recent history of international lending we shall find that ex-
cessive lending first increased the borrowing capacity of debtor
countries, as measured by their debt ratios, and then, when the
banks wanted to be repaid, the debtor countries' ability to do so
evaporated. generally speaking, we shall find that the expansion

the theory of reflexivity 31
and contraction of credit can affect the debtors' ability and will-
i ingness to pay.
are these exceptions that confirm the rule, or do they necessi-
tate a revision of accepted theory? the answer depends on the
frequency and severity of their occurrence. if we are dealing with
an isolated instance, we can treat it as a paradox; but if one inci-
dent follows another, we must question the theory.
i contend that such paradoxical behavior is typical of all finan-
cial markets that serve as a discounting mechanism for future
developments, notably stock markets, foreign exchange markets,
banking, and all forms of credit. microeconomic theory may
continue to ignore it, because there are large areas of economic
activity where it occurs only occasionally or not at all; b&-we
cannot expect to understand macroeconomic developments with-
i out taking the phenomenon into account. a world of fluc-
tuating exchange rates and large-scale capital movements is
characterized by vicious and benign circles in which the "nor-
mal" pattern of causation, as defined by classical economics,
seems to be reversed: market developments dictate the evolu-
tion of the conditions of supply and demand, not the other way
around.
if the process of adjustment does not lead to an equilibrium,
what happens to the conclusions of economic theory? the answer
is that they remain valid as deductions but they lose their rele-
vance to the real world. if we want to understand the real world,
we must divert our gaze from a hypothetical fins outcome and
concentrate our attention on the process of change that we can
observe all around us.
this will require a radical shift in our thinking. a process of
change is much more difficult to understand than a static equilib-
rium. we shall have to revise many of our preconceived ideas
about the kind of understanding that is attainable and satisfy our-
selves with conclusions that are far less definite than those that
economic theory sought to provide.

the problem of imperfect understanding

the understanding of the actual course of events, as distinct from
a hypothetical equilibrium, poses problems that have not been
properly appreciated. the problems arise because participants

32 theory
base their decisions on an inherently imperfect understanding of
the situation in which they participate. there are two related sets
4 of problems to be considered: the imperfect understanding of the
participant and the imperfect understanding of the social scien-
tist. we must be careful not to confuse the two.
in this section i shall try to explain why the participants' un-
derstanding is inherently imperfect. in the next section i shall
examine why the imperfect understanding of the participants
poses difficulties for the social sciences.
the imperfect understanding of the participant is a difficult
concept to define and an even more difficult one to work with. i
shall try to approach it by comparing the position of the partici-
pant vlth that of ;. naturdl scientist. (4 have to specify a natural
scientist, because social scientists are confronted with special
problems arising out of the imperfect understanding of partici-
pants. these will be dealt with in the next section.) the purpose
of the comparison is to establish a standard in terms of which the
understanding of the participant can be called imperfect. what
makes the comparison tricky is that the natural scientist is not
capable of perfect understanding either. far from it. as karl pop-
per has shown,3 it is a cardinal principle of scientific method that
perfect knowledge is not attainable. scientists work by constantly
testing plausible hypotheses and propounding new ones. if they
did not treat all conclusions as provisional and subject to im-
provement, natural science could not have reached its present
state of development and it could not progess any further. al-
though it is far from perfect, the knowledge attained by natural
scientists provides a standard in terms of which the participants'
understanding can be called imperfect.
natural scie~tfsts have oue great advantage over participants:
they deal with phenomena that occur independently of what any-
body says or thinks about them. the phenomena belong to one
universe, the scientists' statements to another. the phenomena
then serve as an independent, objective criterion by which the
truth or validity of scientific statements can be judged. statements
that correspond to the facts are true; those that do not are false.
to the extent that the correspondence can be established, the
scientist's understanding qualifies as knowledge. we do not need
to go into the various difficulties that stand in the way of estab-
lishing the correspondence. the important point is that scientists
have an objective criterion at their disposal.

the theory of reflexivity 3 3
by contrast, the situation to which the participants' thinking
relates is not independently given: it is contingent on their own
decisions. as an objective criterion for establishing the truth or
validity of the participants' views, it is deficient. it does provide
a criterion of sorts: some expectations are validated by subsequent
events, others are not: but the process of validation leaves some-
thing to be desired: one can never be sure whether it is the expec-
tation that corresponds to the subsequent event or the subsequent
event that conforms to the expectation. the segregation between
thoughts and events that prevails in natural science is simply
missing.
thinking plays a dual role. on the one hand, participants seek
to understand the situation in which they participate; on the
other, their understanding serves as the basis of decisions which
influence the course of events. the two roles interfere with each
other. neither role is 'performed as well as it could be if it were
performed separately. if the course of events were independent of
the participants' decisions, the participants' understanding could
equal that of a naturbl scientist; and if participants could base
their decisions on knowledge, however provisional, the results of
their actions would have a better chance of corresponding to their
intentions. as it is, participants act on the basis of imperfect un-
derstanding and the course of events bears the imprint of. that
imperfection.
in a milder form, the lack of separation betwmn the subject
matter and the act of thinking may also arise in natural science.
the most celebrated example is in quantum physics where the
act of observation interferes with the observed phenomenon. it
has given rsss to heisenberg's uncertainty principle which, in
effect, establishes a limit to the scientist's ability to attain knowl-
edge. but in natural science the problem occurs only at the limit,
whereas for the participant it is at the very center of his thinking.
for one thing, the scientist makes a deliberate attempt not to
interfere with his subject matter, whereas the participant's pri-
mary purpose is to mold the situation in which he participates to
his own satisfaction. more important, in quantum physics it is
only the act of observation which interferes with the subject mat-
ter, not the theory of uncertainty, whereas in the case of thinking
participants their own thoughts form part of the subject matter to
which they relate. the positive accomplishments of natural sci-
ence are confined to the area where thinking and events are effec-

34 theory
tively segregated. when events have thinking participants that
area shrinks to the vanishing point.

the problem of the social sciences

we are now in a position to examine the problems of the social
sciences. again, there are two distinct issues to be considered.
one relates to the subject matter, the other to the observer.
scientific method is designed to deal with facts; but, as we have
seen, events which have thinking participants do not consist of
facts alone. the participant's thinking plays a causal rda, ye; i1
does not correspond to the facts for the simple reason that it does
not relate to facts. participants have to deal with a situation that
is contingent on their own decisions; their thinking constitutes
an indispensable ingredient in that situation. whether we treat it
as a fact of a special kind or something other than a fact, the
participants' thinking introduces an element of uncertainty into
the subject matter. this element is absent in the natural sciences.
as we have seen, there is some similarity between the uncertainty
introduced by the participants' thinking and heisenberg's uncer-
tainty principle in quantum physics but, as we shall soon see, the
parallel is misleading.
now for the role of the scientific observer: it is much easier to
maintain the required segregation between facts and statements
when the subject matter itself does not contain any statements,
observations, or thoughts of any kind.
most discussions about the shortcomings of the social sciences
have focused on the second issue. expressioris like "self-fulf lling
prophecies" or "self-defeating experiments" are widely used
but usually they relate to the would-be scientist. yet it is the
self-influencing character of the participants' thinking that is re-
sponsible for the element of uncertainty (or indeterminacy) i men-
tioned before. the difficulties of scientific observation pale into
insignificance when compared with the indeterminacy of the sub-
ject matter. the indeterminacy would remain even if all the prob-
lems relating to the observer were resolved, whereas the problems
of the observer can be directly attributed to the indeterminacy of
the subject matter. thus the problem of the social sciences is not
merely methodological but inherent in the subject matter.
the undue emphasis on the role of the scientific observer can

the theory of reflexivity 3 5
be attributed to the false analogy with heisenberg's uncertainty
principle. i am no expert in quantum physics but, as i understand
it, the principle holds that the mass and velocity of quantum
particles cannot be measured at the same time because the act of
measurement interfergs with the object that is being measured. in
this case, the element* of uncertainty is introduced by the outside
observer. (whether tlje behavior of quantum particles is inher-
ently random is a separate question.) the parallel with the social
sciences is misleading because in the latter case the indetermi-
nacy (uncertainty) is caused by the partikipants. only if quantum
particles behaved as' thinking participants would the analogy
hold.
i shall try to reverse the discussion to its proper order: the
uncertainty in the subject matter first, the role of the scientist
second.
the idea that there' is a fundamental difference in the subject
matter of the natural sand social sciences has not been generally
recognized. on the ccjntrary, karl popper, whom i otherwise ad-
mire, enunciated what he called the "doctrine of the unity of
~cience";~ that is, the same methods and criteria apply in both the
natural and social sciences. although it has not been universally
accepted, it has not been conclusively refuted either. 1 shall try to
do so here.
in order to appreciate the problem posed by thinking partici-
pants, let us take a closer look at the way scientifi95 method oper-
ates. for this purpose i am invoking karl popper's scheme of
scientific method, described in technical terms as the "deductive-
nomological," or "d-n," model. like every model, it presents a
simplified and idealized version of a more comi;lex reiility, but
exactly because it is simple and elegant it suits my purpose very
well.
the model is built on three kinds of statements: specific initial
conditions, specific final conditions, and generalizations of uni-
versal validity. combining a set of generalizations with known
initial conditions yields predictions; combining them with
known final conditions provides explanations; and matching
known initial with known final conditions serves as testing for
the generalizations involved. it can be seen that there is a sym-
metry between predictions and explanations; they are logically
reversible. testing is different, because no amount of testing can
prove that a generalization is universally valid. scientific theories

36 theory
can only be falsified, never verified. the asymmetry between
verification and falsification and the symmetry between predic-
tion and explanation are the two crucial features of popper's
scheme.
the model works only if certain conditions are fulfilled. an
essential condition is that the content of the statements should
exist in total isolation from the statements that are made about
them; only then does the content provide an independent crite-
rion for judging the truth or validity of the statements that relate
to it.* other essential requirements are that the initial and final
conditions should consist of facts which are amenable to scien-
tific observation and the generalizations should, have universal
validity. that is, if a given set of conditions recurred, it would
have to be followed or preceded by the same set of conditions as
before. it can be seen that the requirement of universal validity
defines not only the nature of scientific laws but also the character
of initial and final conditions: they must consist of observable
facts governed by universal laws. it is this requirement that is so
difficult to meet when a situation has thinking participants.
what constitutes scientific observation is a matter of debate that
we need not enter into here. clearly, a single observation by a
single scientist is not admissible. exactly because the correspon-
dence between facts and statements is so difficult to establish,
science is a collective enterprise where the work of each scientist
has to be open to control and criticism by others.
the interaction between scientists is governed by certain con-
ventions. these conventions are neither clearly defined nor per-
manently fixed. they derive their authority from the fact that fiey
produce desired results. individual scientists often find the con-
ventions quite onerous and try various shortcuts in order to attain
a desired result. only because the shortcuts do not work do the
conventions of scientific method continue to prevail.
perhaps the most outstanding example of the observer trying to
impose his will on his subject matter is the attempt to convert
base metal into gold. alchemists struggled long and hard until
they were finally persuaded to abandon their enterprise by their
* interestingly, this condition holds not only for the facts that constitute the
initial and final conditions but also for the generalizations that connect them.
the laws of nature must prevail whether they are recognized or not. this is the
basis of popper's abortive idea of a "third world" of objective thoughts (in
objective knowledge, new york: oxford university press, 1972).

the theory of reflexivity 3 7
lack of success. the lailure was inevitable because the behavior
of base metals is governed by laws of universal validity which
cannot be modified by any statements, incantations, or rituals.
let us now consider the behavior of human beings. do they
obey universally valid laws that can be formulated in accordance
with the d-n model? undoubtedly, there are many aspects of
human behavior, from birth to death and in between, which are
amenable to the same treatment as other natural phenomena. but
there is one aspect of human behavior which seems to exhibit
characteristics different from those of the phenomena which form
the subject matter of natural science: the decision-making pro-
cess. decisions are based on an imperfect understanding of the
situation. how does such a situation provide the initial and final
conditions which are supposed to be connected according to laws
of universal validity? do those conditions include or exclude the
participants' thinking? if thinking is included, the conditions are
not amenable to scientific observation, because only the effects of
the participants' thinking can be observed, not the process itself.
if the thinking process is excluded and only its effects are admit-
ted as evidence, the universal validity of scientific generalizations
is destroyed because a given set of conditions is not necessarily
preceded or succeeded by the same set every time: the sequence
of events is influenced by the participants' thinking, yet there is a
lack of correspondence between the participants' thinking and
the course of events. in either case, the d-n modabreaks down.
this may not be the end of the world, but it is a serious blow to
scientific method. the method has been so successful that we find
it hard to believe that there should be a large and vital area be-
yond its scope. natural science has aiso encountered limitations
in the form of heisenberg's uncertainty principle but the limits
were reached only after a number of impressive accomplishments
-the uncertainty principle itself counts as one of the great dis-
coveries of natural science. in social science we encounter diffi-
culties even before we get started: the imperfect understanding of
the participants is incompatible with the d-n model.
this conclusion is so devastating that every effort has been
made to escape it. to review the various attempts would take a
whole book-and an interesting one at that. i shall confine my
attention to economic theory, which constitutes one of the most
ingenious attempts, and in some ways the most effective one, to
escape the problems connected with imperfect understanding. it

3 8 theory
simply assumes away the problems by erecting a hypothetical
system in which the participants' decisions are fully determined
by the available information. this approach yields conclusions
which meet some of the requirements of the d-n model. for in-
stance, the theory of perfect competition qualifies as universally
valid and-at least in principle-it can be used to explain and
predict conditions with equal force. the theory fails, however,
when it comes to testing, leaving in doubt the relevance of the
hypothetical to actual conditions.
social scientists have gone to great lengths trying to maintain
the unity of method but with remarkably little success. their
endeavors have yielded little more than a parody of natural sci-
ence. in a sense, the attempt to impose the methods of natural
science on social phenomena is comparable to the efforts of alche-
mists who sought to apply the methods of magic to the field of
natural science. but while the failure of the alchemists was well-
nigh total, social scientists have maqaged to make a considerable
impact on their subject matter. situations which have thinking
participants may be impervious to the methods of natural'science,
but they are susceptible to the methods of alchemy. the thinking
of participants, exactly because it is not governed by reality, is
easily influenced by theories. in the field of natural phenomena,
scientific method is effective only when its theories are valid; but
in social, political, and economic matters, theories can be effec-
tive without being valid. whereas alchemy has failed as natural
science, social science can succeed as alchemy.
this brings us to an examination of the relationship between
the scientist and his subject matter. as we have seen, the id-n
model requires that scie2iists keep their statements and observa-
tions rigorously segregated from the subject matter to which they
relate; only then can the subject matter fulfill its function and
serve as an objective criterion for judging the truth or validity of
scientific statements. the conventions of scientific method are
designed to maintain the required segregation.
in natural science the conventions are effective because the
scientist's thinking is, in fact, distinct from its subject matter. the
scientist can influence the subject matter only by actions, not by
thoughts, and the scientist's actions are guided by the same laws
as all other natural phenomena. specifically, nothing the scientist
can do will turn base metals into gold. the scientist may gain
some personal advantage by flouting the conventions of science,

the theory of reflexivity 39
but the advantage is achieved only by a deception which is liable
to be revealed by those who abide by the conventions.
social phenomena are different. the imperfect understanding
of the participant interferes with the proper functioning of the
d-n model. this has far-reaching implications for the conven-
tions of scientific method. it limits the results that can be pro-
duced by observing thk conventions and, what is worse, it opens
the way to attaining worthwhile results by transgressing them.
there is much to be gained by pretending to abide by the conven-
tions of scientific method without actually doing so. natural sci-
ence is held in great esteem: a theory that claims to be scientific
can influence the gullible public much better than one whicn
frankly admits its political or ideological bias. i only need to
mention marxism and psychoanalysis as typical examples; but
laissez-faire capitalism, with its reliance on the theory of perfect
competition, is also a: case in point. it is noteworthy that both
marx and freud were vocal in protesting their scientific status
and based many of their conclusions on the authority they de-
rived from being "scientific." once this point sinks in, the very
expression "social science" becomes suspect. it is a magic word
employed by social alchemists in their effort to impose their will
on their subject matter by incantation.
how can the "true" practitioners of scientific method protect
themselves against such malpractice? it seems to me that there is
only one way out: to deprive social science of theeatus it enjoys
on account of natural science. social science ought to be recog-
nized as a false metaphor.
that does not mean that we must give up the pursuit of truth
in exploring social phenomena. it means only that the pursuit of
truth requires us to recognize that the d-n model does not apply
to situations with thinking participants. we must abandon the
doctrine of the unity of method and cease the slavish imitation of
natural science.
the d-n model has been so successful in natural science that it
has come to be equated with scientific method. ironically, the
model has been largely superseded in modern natural science; the
social sciences, however, are still trying to compete with the ac-
complishments of nineteenth-century natural science. the at-
tempt is in vain because, as we have seen, the subject matter does
not fit the d-n mold. but, as quantum physics has shown, scien-
tific method is not necessarily confined to the d-n model: statis-

40 theory
tical, probabilistic generalizations may prove more fruitful. nor
should we ignore the possibility of developing novel approaches
which have no counterpart in natural science. given the differ-
ences in subject matter, there ought to be differences in the
method of study.
i shall explore a novel approach in this book, but before i start,
i want to make sure that it will not be judged by the standards of
the d-n model. a world of imperfect understanding does not lend
itself to generalizations which can be used to explain and to pre-
dict specific events. the symmetry between explanation and pre-
diction prevails only in the absence of thinking participants.
otherwise, predictions must always be conditioned on the partic-
ipants' perceptions; thus they cannot have the finality which they
enjoy in the d-n model. on the other hand, past events are just as
final as in the d-n model; thus, ex*nation turns out to be an
easier task than prediction. once we abandon the constraint that
predictions and explanations are logically reversible, we can
build a theoretical framework which is appropriate to the subject
matter. unfortunately, the theory cannot be tested in the same
way ;as those which fit into popper's logical structure. that is not
to say that testing must be abandoned; on the contrary, as long as
we remain concerned with understanding things as they are, we
ought to insist on testing our views. we need to develop novel
ways of testing. i shall do so in the real-time experiment that
frankly admits, and exploits, the alchemical potential in the study
of social phenomena (part 111).

the participants' bias

my approach is to tackle the problem of imperfect understanding
head on. what makes the participants' understanding imperfect
is that their thinking affects the situation to which it relates. the
causal role played by the participants' thinking has no counter-
part in the phenomena studied by natural scientists. it is ob-
viously not the only force shaping the course of events, but it is a
force which is unique to events that have thinking participants.
hence it deserves to take center stage.
as we have seen, imperfect understanding is a very difficult
concept to work with. we have established that there is a lack of
correspondence between the participant's thinking and the situa-

the theory of reflexivity 41
tion to which it relates; but the lack of correspondence is difficult
to define, let alone measure. the participant's thinking is part of
the situation to which it relates and the very idea of correspon-
dence is inappropriate to describing a relationship between a part
and a whole. the idea :was imported from natural science, where
facts and statements belong to separate universes and from phi-
losophy, where correspondence serves as the criterion of truth.
the analogy does not apply to the participant who is, by defini-
tion, part of the situation that he is trying to understand. we can
speak of a lack of correspondence, but we cannot define that to
which the participant's understanding fails to correspond be-
cause it sillrply does dot exist. to simplify rn~tttzrs, i sha!! speak
of an inherent bias in the participants' thinking. since the bias is
inherent, the unbiased is unattainable.
there is, however, a norm in the outside world against which
the participants' bias can be measured. although there is no real-
ity independent of the participants* perception, there is a reality
that is dependent on ;it. in other words, there is a sequence of
events that actually occurs and that sequence reflects the partici-
pants' behavior. the actual course of events is likely to differ from
the participants' expectations and the divergence can be taken as
an indication of the participants' bias. unfortunately, it can be
taken only as an indication-not as the full measure of the bias-
because the actual course of events already incorporates the ef-
fects of the participants' thinking. thus the participants' bias
finds expression both in the divergence between outcome and
expectations and in the actual course of events. a phenomenon
that is partially observable and partially submerged in the course
of events does not lend itself readily to scientific investigatiorr.
we can now appreciate why economists were so anxious to elim-
inate it from their theories. we shall make it the focal point of our
investigation.

the concept of reflexivity

the connection between the participants' thinking and the situa-
tion in which they participate can be broken up into two func-
tional relationships. i call the participants' efforts to understand
the situation the cognitive or passive function and the impact of
their thinking on the real world the participating or active func-

42 theory
tion. in the cognitive function, the participants' perceptions de-
i pend on the situation; in the participating function, the situation
is influenced by the participants' perceptions. it can be seen that
the two functions work in opposite directions: in the cognitive
function the independent variable is the situation; in the partici-
pating function it is the participants' thinking.
there are many cases where one or the other function can be
observed in isolation but there are also instances where they are
both operating at the same time. an obvious example of the cog-
nitive function is when someone learns from experience. exam-
ples of the participating function are to be found in textbooks of
economics where the participants apply a given set of preferences
to a given set of opportunities and in the process determine
4 prices.
when both functions operate at the same time, they interfere
with each other. functions need an independent variable in order
to produce a determinate result, but in this case the independent
variable of one function is the dependent variable of the other.
instead of a determinate result, we have an interplay in which
both the situation and the participants' views are dependent vari-
ables so that an initial change precipitates further changes both in
the situation and in the participants' views. i call this interaction
"reflexivity," using the word as the french do when they describe
a verb whose subject and object are the same. using simple math-
ematics, reflexivity can be depicted as a pair of recursive func-
tions:

y = f (x) cognitive function
x = + (yj partlcipati~~g function
therefore,

this is the theoretical foundation of my approach. the two
recursive functions do not produce an equilibrium but a never-
ending process of change. the process is fundamentally different
from the processes that are studied by natural science. there, one
set of facts follows another without any interference from
thoughts or perceptions (although in quantum physics, observa-

the theory of reflexivity 43
tion introduces uncertqinty). when a situation has thinking par-
ticipants, the sequence of events does not lead directly from one
set of facts to the next; rather, it connects facts to perceptions and
perceptions to facts in a shoelace pattern. thus, the concept of
reflexivity yields a "shoelace" theory of history.
it must be recognized that the shoelace theory is a kind of di-
alectic. it can be intergreted as a synthesis of hegel's dialectic of
ideas and marx's dialectical materialism. instead of either
thoughts or material conditions evolving in a dialectic fashion on
their own, it is the interplay between the two that produces a
dialectic process. the' only reason i do not use the word more
prominently is that i do not want .icu be burdened by the excess ,
luggage that comes with it. i find hegel obscure, and marx pro-
pounded a deterministic theory of history that is diametrically
opposed to my own view.
the historical process, as i see it, is open ended. its main driv-
ing force is the participants' bias. to be sure, it is not the only
force at work, but it js a force that is unique to the historical
process and sets it apart from the processes studied by natural
science. biological evblution is attributed to genetic mutation; i
contend that historical processes are shaped by the misconcep-
tions of the participants. i would even go as far as to say that the
ideas that make histor) consist of fertile fallacies. a fertile fallacy
is originally conceived as an insight; only when it is translated
into reality do its shortcomings become apparenmt then begets
another fertile fallacy that is antithetical to it, and so it goes. each
fallacy provides a new experience and, to the extent that people
learn from experience, the process can be described as progress.
fallacy is, of course, too strong a word, but it is helpful in direct-
ing attention in the right direction: to the participants' bias.
i shall not pursue the subject further here, but it is obvious that
the concept of reflexivity, as described here, has implications far
beyond the range of topics tackled in this book.

reflexivity versus equilibrium

returning to economic theory, it can be argued that it is the par-
ticipants' bias that renders the equilibrium position unattainable.
the target toward which the adjustment process leads incorpo-
rates a bias, and the bias may shift in the process. when that

44 theory
happens, the process aims not at an equilibrium but at a moving
target.
to put matters into perspective, we may classify events into
two categories: humdrum, everyday events that are correctly an-
ticipated by the participants and do not provoke a change in their
perceptions, and unique, historical events that affect the partici-
pants' bias and lead to further changes. the first kind of event is
susceptible to equilibrium analysis, the second is not: it can be
understood only as part of a historical process.
in everyday events, only the participating function is operative;
the cognitive function is given. in the case of unique, historic
developments, both functions operate simuitaneously so that nei-
ther the participants' views nor the situation to which they relate
remain the same as they were before. that is what justifies de-
scribing such developments as historic.
it should be emphasized that my definition of historical change
involves a tautology. first, i classify events according to their '
effect on the participants' bias: those that alter the participant's
bias are historic and those that do not are humdrum. i then claim
that it is changes in the participants' bias that qualify a course of
events as historical.
tautologies can be useful, provided they are recognized as
such. in this case it helps to put equilibrium analysis into the
proper perspective. i have defined historical change as an inter-
play between the cognitive and participating functions. what
makes the change historical is that it affects both the course of
events and the participants' perceptions so that the next event
cannot be a mere repetition of the one that preceded 'it.
equilibrium analysis eliminates historical change by assum-
ming away the cognitive function. the supply and demand curves
utilized by economic theory are expressions of the participating
function only. the cognitive function is replaced by the assump-
tion of perfect knowledge. if the cognitive function were operat-
ing, events in the marketplace could alter the shape of the demand
and supply curves, and the equilibrium studied by economists
need never be reached.
how significant is the omission of the cognitive function? in
other words, how significant is the distortion introduced by ne-
glecting the participants' bias?
in microeconomic analysis, the distortion is negligible and the
participants' bias can be accounted for easily. as a first step, the

the theory of reflexivity 45
participants' bias can be taken as given: that provides a static
equilibrium. to make the analysis more dynamic, changes in the
participants' bias can be added piecemeal, expressed as changes
in consumer habits or production methods. all that is obscured
by this piecemeal approach is the possible connection between
the various changes in the conditions of supply and demand, but
that omission does nbt invalidate the conclusions microeconomic
analysis seeks to establish.
when it comes to financial markets, the distortion is more seri-
ous. the participants' bias is an element in determining prices
and no important niarket development leaves the participants'
bias unaffected. the'search for an equilibrium price turns out to
be a wild goose chase and theories about the equilibrium price
can themselves become a fertile source of bias. to paraphrase j.
p. morgan, financial markets will continue to fluctuate.
in trying to deal with macroeconomic developments, equilib-
rium analysis is totally inappropriate. nothing could be further
removed from reality than the assumption that participants base
their decisions on perfect knowledge. people are groping to antic-
ipate the future with the help of whatever guideposts they can
establish. the outcome tends to diverge from expectations, lead-
ing to constantly chgnging expectations and constantly changing
outcomes. the process is reflexive.
in his general theory of employment, interest and money,
keynes managed to show that full employmentt% a special case;
if we could develop a general theory of reflexivity, equilibrium
would appear as a special case. while it will hardly qualify as a
general theory, i shall try to explore the role of reflexivity in
financial markets; that means that i shall try to inierpret their
functioning as a historical process.

reflexivity ln the stock market

in trying to develop a theory of reflexivity, i shall start with the
stock market. for one thing, it is the market i am most familiar
with: i have been a professional investor for more than twenty- .
five years. for another, the stock market provides an excellent
laboratory for testing theories: changes are expressed in quantita-
tive terms and the data are easily accessible. even the partici-
pants' views are usually available in the form of brokers' reports.
most important, i have actually tested my theory in the stock
market and 1 have some interesting case studies to present.
as i mentioned in the introduction, i did not develop my ideas
on reflexivity in connection with my activities in the stock mar-
ket. the theory of reflexivity started out as abstract philosophical
speculation and only gradually did i discover its ~ l e v ~ n c eto t?ae
behavior of stock prices. i was singularly unsuccessful in formu-
lating my theory at the level of abstraction at which i conceived
it: my failure as a philosopher stands in stark contrast with my
career as an investment professional. i hope that by presenting
my ideas in the reverse order from the one in which i arrived at
them i may be able to avoid getting lost in arcane abstractions.
there is yet another reason why the stock market may provide
the best entry point for the study of reflexive phenomena. the
stock market comes as close to meeting the criteria of perfect
competition as any market: a central marketplace, homogeneous
products, low transaction and transportation costs, instant com-
munications, a large enough crowd of participants to ensure that
no individual can influence market prices in the ordinary course
of events, and special rules for insider transactions as well as

reflexivity in the stock market 4 7
special safeguards to provide all participants with access to rele-
vant information. what more can one ask for? if there is any place
where the theory of perfect competition ought to beatranslated
into practice, it is in the stock market.
yet there is little edpirical evidence of an equilibrium or even
a tendency for prices tp move toward an equilibrium. the concept
of an equilibrium seems irrelevant at best and misleading at
worst. the evidence shows persistent fluctuations, whatever
length of time is chosen as the period of observation. admittedly,
the underlying conditions that are supposed to be reflected in
stock prices are also ,constantly changing, but it is difficult to
establish any firm relationship between changes in stock prices
and changes in underlying conditions. whatever relationship can
be established has to be imputed rather than observed. i intend to
use the theory of reflexivity to criticize the preoccupation of eco-
nomic theory with the equilibrium position. what better example
could i find than the stock market?
existing theories about the behavior of stock prices are remark-
ably inadequate. they are of so little value to the practitioner that
i am not even fully familiar with them. the fact that i could get
by without them speaks for itself.
generally, theories fall into two categories: fundamentalist and
technical. more recently, the random walk theory has come into
vogue; this theory holds that the market fully discsunts all future
developments so that the individual participant's chances of
over- or underperforming the market as a whole are even. this
line of argument has served as theoretical justification for the
increasing number of institutions that inyest their money in index
funds. the theory is manifestly false-i have disproved it by con-
sistently outperforming the averages over a period of twelve
years. institutions may be well advised to invest in index funds
rather than making specific investment decisions, but the reason
is to be found in their substandard performance, not in the impos-
sibility of outperforming the averages.
technical analysis studies market patterns and the demand and
supply of stocks. it has undoubted merit in predicting probabili-
ties but not the actual course of events. for the purposes of this
discussion it is of no particular interest, because it has little the-
oretical foundation other than the assertions that stock prices are
determined by their supply and demand and that past experience
is relevant in predicting the future.
fundamental analysis is more interesting because it is an out-

48 theory
growth of equilibrium theory. stocks are supposed to have a true
i or fundamental value as distinct from their current market price.
the fundamental value of a stock may be defined either in rela-
tion to the earning power of the underlying assets or in relation
to the fundamental value of other stocks. in either case, the mar-
ket price of a stock is supposed to tend toward its fundamental
value over a period of time so that the analysis of fundamental
values provides a useful guide to investment decisions.
the important point about this approach is that the connection
between stock prices and the companies whose stocks are traded
is assumed to be in one direction. the fortunes of the companies
determins--however belatedly-the relative values of the var-
ious stocks traded in the stock market. the possibility that stock
market developments may affect the fortunes of the companies is
left out of account. there is a clear parallel with the theory of
price where the indifference curve determines the relative
amounts consumed, and the possibility that the market may influ-
ence the indifference curve is disregarded. the parallel is not
accidental: the fundamentalist approach is based on the theory of
price. but the omission is more glaring in the stock market than
in other markets. stock market valuations have a direct way of
influencing underlying values: through the issue and repurchase
of shares and options and through corporate transactions of all
kinds-mergers, acquisitions, going public, going private, and so
on. there are also more subtle ways in which stock prices may
influence the standing of a company: credit rating, consumer ac-
ceptance, management credibility, etc. the influence of these fac-
tors on stock prices is, of course, fully recognized; it is the
influence of stock pric2s on these factors that is so strangely ig-
nored by the fundamentalist approach.
if there are any glaring discrepancies between prevailing stock
prices and fundamental values, they are attributed to future de-
velopments in the companies concerned that are not yet known
but are correctly anticipated by the stock market. movements in
stock prices are believed to precede the developments that sub-
sequently justify them. how future developments ought to be dis-
counted is the subject of an ongoing debate, but it is presumed
that the market is doing the job correctly even if the correct
method cannot be theoretically established. this point of view
follows naturally from the theory of perfect competition. it is
summed up in the assertion that "the market is always right." the

reflexivity in the stock market 49
assertion is generally accepted, even by people who do not put
much faith in fundamental analysis.
i take a totally opposite point of view. i do not accept the prop-
osition that stock prices are a passive reflection of underlying
values, nor do i accept rhe proposition that the reflection tends to
correspond to the underlying value. i contend that market valua-
tions are always distohed; moreover-and this is the crucial de-
parture from equilibrium theory-the distortions can affect the
underlying values. stock prices are not merely passive reflections;
they are active ingredients in a process in which both stock prices
and the fortunes of the companies whose stocks are traded are
determined. in other words, i regard changes in stock prices as
part of a historical process and i focus on the discrepancy be-
tween the participants' expectations and the actual course of
events as a causal factor in that process.
to explain the process, i take the discrepancy as my starting
point. i do not rule out the possibility that events may actually
correspond to people's expectations, but i treat it as a limiting
case. translating this assertion into market terms, i claim that
market participants are always biased in one way or another. i do
not deny that markets have a predictive or anticipating power that
seems uncanny at times, but i argue that it can be explained by
the influence that the participants' bias has on the course of
events. for instance, the stock market is generally believed to
anticipate recessions; it would be more correct to""say that it can
help to precipitate them. thus i replace the assertion that markets
are always right with two others:

1. markets are always biased in one direction or another.
2. markets can influence the events that they anticipate.

the combination of these two assertions explains why markets
may so often appear to anticipate events correctly.
using the participants' bias as our starting point, we can try to
build a model of the interaction between the participants' views
and the situation in which they participate. what makes the anal-
ysis so difficult is that the participants' views are part of the
situation to which they relate. to make any sense of such a com-
plex situation, we need to simplify it. i introduced a simplifying
concept when i spoke of the participants' bias. now i want to take

50 theory
the argument a step further and introduce the concept of a pre-
vailing bias.
markets have many participants, whose views are bound to
differ. i shall assume that many of the individual biases cancel
each other out, leaving what i call the "prevailing bias." this
assumption is not appropriate to all historical processes but it
does apply to the stock market and to other markets as well. what
makes the procedure of aggregating individual perceptions legit-
imate is that they can be related to a common denominator,
namely, stock prices. in other historical processes, the partici-
pants' views are too diffuse to be aggregated and the concept of a
prevailing bias becomes !ittie more clan a metaphor. in these
cases a different model may be needed, but in the stock market
the participants' bias finds expression in purchases and sales.
other things being equal, a positive bias leads to rising stock
prices and a negative one to falling prices. thus the prevailing
bias is an observable phenomenon.
other things are, of course, never equal. we need to know a
little more about those "other things" in order to build our model.
at this point i shall introduce a second simplifying concept. i
shall postulate an "underlying trend" that influences the move-
ment of stock prices whether it is recognized by investors or not.
the influence on stock prices will, of course, vary, depending on
the market participants' views. the trend in stock prices can then
be envisioned as a composite of the "underlying trend" and the
"prevailing bias."
how do these two factors interact? it will be recalled that there
are two connections at play: the participating and the cognitive
functions. the underlying trend influences the participants' per-
ceptions through the cognitive function; the resulting change in
perceptions affects the situation through the participating func-
tion. in the case of the stock market, the primary impact is on
stock prices. the change in stock prices may, in tun, affect both
the participants' bias and the underlying trend.
we have here a reflexive relationship in which stock prices are
determined by two factors-underlying trend and prevailing bias
-both of which are, in turn, influenced by stock prices. the in-
terplay between stock prices and the other two factors has no
constant: what is supposed to be the independent variable in one
function is the dependent variable in the other. without a con-
stant, there is no tendency toward equilibrium. the sequence of

reflexivity in the stock market 51
events is best interpreted as a process of historical change in
which none of the variables-stock prices, underlying trend, and
prevailing bias-remains as it was before. in the typical sequence
the three variables reinforce each other first in one direction and
then in the other in a battern that is known, in its simplest form,
as boom and bust. '
first, we must startowith some definitions. when stock prices
reinforce the underlyihg trend, we shall call the trend self-rein-
forcing; when they work in the opposite direction, self-correcting.
the same terminology holds for the prevailing bias: it can be self-
reinforcing or self-correcting. it is important to realize what these
terms mean. when a trend is reinforced, it accelerates. yhsn the
bias is reinforced, the divergence between expectations and the
actual course of future stock prices gets wider and, conversely,
when it is self-correcting, the divergence gets narrower. as far as
stock prices are concerned, we shall describe them simply as ris-
ing and falling. when the prevailing bias helps to raise prices we
shall call it positive; ,when it works in the opposite direction,
negative. thus rising prices are reinforced by a positive bias and
falling prices by a negative one. in a boomhust sequence we
would expect to find at least one stretch where rising prices are
reinforced by a positive bias and another where falling prices are
reinforced by a negative bias. there must also be a point where
the underlying trend and the prevailing bias combine to reverse
the trend in stock prices. “ee
let us now try to build a rudimentary model of boom and bust.
we start with an underlying trend that is not yet recognized-
although a prevailing bias that is not yet reflected in stock prices
is also conceivable. thus, the prevziling bias is negstive to start
with. when the market participants recognize -che trend, this
change in perceptions will affect stock prices. the change in stock
prices may or may not affect the underlying trend. in the latter
case, there is little more to discuss. in the former case we have the
beginning of a self-reinforcing process.
the enhanced trend will affect the prevailing bias in one of two
ways: it will lead to the expectation of further acceleration or to
the expectation of a correction. in the latter case, the underlying
trend may or may not survive the correction in stock prices. in
the former case, a positive bias develops causing a further rise in
stock prices and a further acceleration in the underlying trend. as
long as the bias is self-reinforcing, expectations rise even faster

5 theory
2
than stock prices. the underlying trend becomes increasingly in-
t fluenced by stock prices and the rise in stock prices becomes
increasingly dependent on the prevailing bias, so that both the
underlying trend and the prevailing bias become increasingly vul-
nerable. eventually, the trend in prices cannot sustain prevailing
expectations and a correction sets in. disappointed expectations
have a negative effect on stock prices, and faltering stock prices
weaken the underlying trend. if the underlying trend has become
overly dependent on stock prices, the correction may turn into a
total reversal. in that case, stock prices fall, the underlying trend
is reversed, and expectations fall even further. in this way, a self-
reinforcing process gets started in the opposite dircctior,. evge
tually, the downturn also reaches a climax and reverses itself.
typically, a self-reinforcing process-undergoes orderly correc-
i tions in the early stages, and, if it survives them, the bias tends to
be reinforced, and is less easily shaken. when the process is ad-
vanced, corrections become scarcer and the danger of a climactic
reversal greater.
i have sketched out a typical boomhust sequence. it can be
illustrated by two curves that follow more or less the same direc-
tion. one represents stock prices, and the other, earnings per
share. it would be natural to envision the earnings curve as a
measure of the underlying trend, and the divergence between the
two curves as an indication of the underlying bias. the relation-
ship is much more complex. the earnings curve incorporates not
only the underlying trend but also the influence of stock prices
on that trend; the prevailing bias is expressed only partially by
the divergence between the two curves-partially it is already
reflected in those curves. concepts that are only partially observ-
able are extremely difficult to work with; that is why we have
chosen variables that can be observed and quantified-although,
as we shall see later, the quantification of earnings per share can
be very misleading. for present purposes, we shall assume that
the "fundamentals" in which investors are interested are properly
measured by earnings per share.
a typical path for the two curves may be as follows. (see the
figure below.) at first, recognition of an underlying trend is lag-
ging but the trend is strong enough to manifest itself in earnings
per share (ab). when the underlying trend is finally recognized,
it is reinforced by rising expectations (bc). doubts arise, but the
trend survives. alternatively, the trend waivers but reasserts it-

self. such testing may be repeated several times, but here i show
it only once (cd). ~ventuall~, conviction develops and it is no
longer shaken by a setback in the earning trend (de). expectations
become excessive, and fail to be sustained by reality (ef). the
bias is recognized as such and expectations are lowered (fg).
stock prices lose their, last prop and plunge (g). the underlying
trend is reversed, reinforcing the decline (gh). eventually, the
pessimism becomes overdone and the market stabilizes (hi).
it should be emphasized that this is only one po&ble path that
results from the interplay of a single underlying trend and a pre-
vailing bias. there could be more than one trend at work and the
prevailing bias could have many nuances, so that the sequence of
events might require a totally different representation.
a few words about the theoretical construction of the model
may be in order. we are interested in the interplay between the
participants' bias and the actual course of events. yet the partici-
pants' bias is not directly represented in our model; both curves
denote the actual course of events. the prevailing bias is partially
incorporated in the two curves and partially denoted by the di-
vergence between them.
the great merit of this construction is that it uses variables that
can be quantified. stock prices serve as a convenient proxy for the
situation to which the participants' bias relates. in other historical
processes the situation that is interconnected with the partici-

54 theory
pants' perception by the cognitive and participating functions is
more difficult to identify and impossible to quantify. it is the
t availability of a convenient proxy that renders the stock market
such a useful laboratory for studying reflexivity.
unfortunately, the model offers only a partial explanation of
how stock prices are determined. the concept of an underlying
trend has been introduced as a placeholder term, to denote
changes in the "fundamentals." what the fundamentals are has
not been defined. even the question of how the fundamentals are
to be measured has not been answered. earnings, dividends, asset
value, free cash flow: all these yardsticks are relevant, as well as
many others, but the relative weight given to each depends on the
investors' jadgments and is therefore subject to their bias. we may
use earnings per share for purposes of illustration, but that merely
4 begs the question. it is a question security analysts have been
struggling with for a long time. we do not need to answer it here
in order to develop a theory of reflexivity.
without knowing afiything about the fundamentals we can
make some worthwhile generalizations. the first generalization is
that stock prices must have some effect on the fundamentals
(whatever they are), in order to create a boomhust pattern. some-
times the connection is direct, as in the examples i shall use in
this chapter, but generally it is indirect. often it makes its effect
felt through a political process, such as changes in taxation, or
regulation, or attitudes to saving and investment.
it is possible to have a reflexive connection between stock
prices and the prevailing bias even if the fundamentals remain
unaffected, but the connection becomes interesting only if the
fundamentals are also involved. without a change in fundamen-
tals, the prevailing bias is likely to be corrected in short order, as
we can observe in the daily fluctuations of stock prices. it would
be quite in order to ignore the bias as mere noise. that is what the
theory of perfect competition and the fundamentalist approach to
security analysis have done. by contrast, when the fundamentals
are affected, the bias cannot be left out of account without se-
rious distortion, because the bias gives rise to a self-reinforcing/
self-defeating process that leaves neither stock prices, nor the
fundamentals, nor the participants' views the same as they were
before.
the second generalization is that there is bound to be a flaw in
the participants' perception of the fundamentals. the flaw may

reflexivity in the stock market 55
not be apparent in the early stages but it is likely to manifest itself
later on. when it does, it sets the stage for a reversal in the pre-
vailing bias. if the change in bias reverses the underlying trend a
self-reinforcing process is set in motion in the opposite direction.
what the flaw is and how and when it is likely to manifest itself
are the keys to understanding boomhust sequences.
the model i presented above is built on these two generaliza-
tions. it hardly needs emphasizing how crude the mode1 is.
nevertheless, it is valuable in identifying the crucial features of a
typical boombust sequence. these are the unrecognized trend;
the beginning of a self-reinforcing process; the successful test; the
growing conviction, resulting in a widening divergence between
reality and expectations; the flaw in perceptions; the climax; a
self-reinforcing process in the opposite direction. just by identi-
fying these features we can gain some insight into the behavior of
stock prices. we cannot expect much more from our rudimentary
model.
in any case, a reflexive model cannot take the place of funda-
mental analysis: all it can do is to provide an ingredient that is
missing from it. in principle, the two approaches could be recon-
ciled. fundamental analysis seeks to establish how underlying
values are reflected in stock prices, whereas the theory of re-
flexivity shows how stock prices can influence underlying
values. one provides a static picture, the other a dynamic
one.
a theory that offers a partial explanation of st@% price move-
ments can be very useful to the investor especially if it illumi-
nates a relationship that other investors fail to grasp. investors
operate with limited funds and limited intelligence: they do not
need to know everything. as long as they understand something
better than others, they have an edge. the trouble with any kind
of specialized knowledge is that one's area of expertise may not
be especially interesting, but the theory of reflexivity serves to
identify historically significant price movements, so it goes right
to the heart of the matter.
the rudimentary model i have outlined above has proved
extremely rewarding in my career as an investor. that may
seem surprising because the model is so simple and it fits a well-
trodden stock market pattern so well that one would expect every
investor to be familiar with it. yet, that is not the case. why? part
of the answer must be that market participants have been mis-

56 theory
guided by a different theoretical construction, one derived from
classical economics and, even more important, from the natural
4 sciences. the ingrained attitude is that stock prices are the pas-
sive reflection of some underlying reality and not an active ingre-
dient in the historical process. this view is simply false. it is
remarkable that the error has still not been fully recognized.
nevertheless, investors do recognize the sequence i have de-
scribed and do respond to it, only they respond later than some-
one who is working with the appropriate model and is on the
lookout for the crucial features that define the shape of the price
curve. that is what has given me my edge.
the first time i used the model systematically was in the cm-
glomerate boom oi the late 1960s. it enabled me to make money
both on the way up and on the way down.
i the key to the conglomerate boom was a pre~ailing misconcep-
tion among investors. investors had come to value growth in
per-share earnings and failed to discriminate about the way the
earnings growth was accomplished. a few companies learned to
produce earnings growth through acquisitions. once the market
started to reward them for their performance, their task became
easier because they could offer their own highly priced stock in
acquiring other companies.
in theory, the process works as follows. let us assume that all
of the companies involved have the same intrinsic growth in earn-
ings but the stock of the acquiring company sells at twice the
earnings multiple of the acquired ones; if the acquiring company
manages to double its size, its earnings per share jump by 50%,
and its growth rate increases accordingly.
in practice, the early conglnmerates started out with high in-
trinsic growth rates that were rewarded by high multiples. several
of the pathbreakers were high-technology companies with a
strong defense component whose managements recognized that
their historic growth rate could not be sustained indefinitely: tex-
tron, teledyne, ling-temco-vought (later ltv), to mention a few.
they started to acquire more mundane companies, but, as their
per-share earnings growth accelerated, the multiples expanded
instead of contracting. their success attracted imitators and later
on even the most humdrum companies could attain a high multi-
ple by going on an acquisition spree. for instance, the bulk of
ogden's earnings was derived from trading scrap metal; neverthe-
less, the stock sold at more than twenty times earnings at its peak.

reflexivity in the stock market 5 7
eventually, a company could achieve a high multiple just by
promising to put it to good use by making acquisitions.
managements developed special accounting techniques that en-
hanced the impact of acquisitions. they also introduced changes
in the acquired compahies, streamlining operations, disposing of
assets, and generally; focusing on the bottom line, but these
changes were less sigriificant than the impact on per-share earn-
ings of the acquisitions themselves.
investors responded like indians to firewater. at first, the rec-
ord of each company was judged on its own merit, but gradually
conglomerates became recognized as a group. a new breed of
investors emerged, thp so-called go-go fund managers, or gun-
slingers, who developed a special affinity with the managements
of conglomerates. direct lines of communication were opened
between them and conglomerates would place so-called "letter
stock" directly with investors. eventually, conglomerates learned
to manage their stock prices as well as their earnings.
events followed th4 sequence described in my model. multi-
ples expanded and eventually reality could not sustain expecta-
tions. more and more people realized the misconception on
which the boom rested even as they continued to play the game.
acquisitions had to get larger and larger in order to maintain the
momentum, and in the end they ran into the limits of size. the
climactic event was the attempt by saul steinberg to acquire
chemical bank: it was fought and defeated by the establishment.
when stock prices started to fall, the decline fedon itself. the
favorable impact of acquisitions on per-share earnings dimin-
ished and eventually it became impractical to make new acquisi-
tions. the internal problems that had been swept under the carpet
during the period of rapid external growth began to surface. earn-
ings reports revealed unpleasant surprises. investors became dis-
illusioned and managements went through their own crises: after
the heady days of success, few were willing to buckle down to
the burdens of day-to-day management. the situation was aggra-
vated by recession, and many of the high-flying conglomerates
literally disintegrated. investors were prepared to believe the
worst and in some cases the worst actually occurred. in others,
reality turned out to be better than expectations and eventually
the situation stabilized with the surviving companies, often under
new management, slowly working themselves out from under the
debris.

theory
the conglomerate boom is particularly well suited to serve as
an illustration of my rudimentary model because the "fundamen-
4 tals" are readily quantified. investors based their valuations on
reported per-share earnings. however meaningless the figures,
they provide charts that closely conform to my theoretical proto-
type. here they are:

my best documented encounter with a boom/bust sequence is
that of real estate investment trusts. reits, as they are called,
are a special corporate form brought into existence by legislation.
their key feature is that they can distribute their income free of
corporate taxation, provided they distribute all the income they
receive. the opportunity created by this legislation remained
largely unexploited until 1969 when a large number of reits
were founded. i was present at the creation and, fresh from my
experience with conglomerates, recognized their boom/bust po-
tential. i published a research report whose key part reads as

the c a s ~ for mortgage trusts
(february 1970)

the concept
superficially, mortgage trusts seem to resemble mutual funds
designed to provide h i ~ hcurrent yields. but the analogy is mis-
leading. the true attraction of mortgage trusts lies in their ability
to generate capital gains for their shareholders by selling additional
shares at a premium over book value. if a trust with a book value
of $10 and a 12% return on equity doubles its equity by selling
additional shares at $20, the book value jumps to $13.33 and per-
share earnings go from $1.20 to $1.60.
investors are willing to pay a premium because of the high yield
and the expectation of per-share earnings growth. the higher the
premium, the easier it is for the trust to fulfill this expectation. the
process is a self-reinforcing one. once it gets under way, the trust
can show a steady growth in per-share earnings despite the fact
that it distributes practjcally all its earnings as dividends. investors
who participate in the process early enough can enjoy the com-
pound benefits of a high return on equity, a rising book value, and
a rising premium over book value.
analytical approach
the conventional method of security analysis is to try and pre-
dict the future course of earnings and then to estimate the price
that investors may be willing to pay for those earnings. this
method is inappropriate to the analysis of mortgage trusts because
the price that investors are willing to pay for the shares is an im-
portmt factor in determining the future course of earnings.
instead of predicting future earnings and valuations separately,
we shall try to predict the future course of the entire self-
reinforcing process. we shall identify three major factors which
reinforce each other and we shall sketch out a scenario of the
probable course of development. the three factors are:

1. the effective rate of return on the mortgage trust's capital
2. the rate of growth of the mortgage trust's size
3. investor recognition, i.e., the multiple investors are willing
to pay for a given rate of growth in per-share earnings

62 theory

the scenario
act one: at present, the effective yield on construction loans is at
an optimum. not only are interest rates high but losses are at a
relatively low level. there is a pent-up demand for housing and
new houses readily find buyers. there is a shortage of funds so that
the projects which do get off the ground are economically well
justified. builders who are still in business are more substantial
and more reliable than at the tail end of a boom. moreover, they do
their utmost to complete the construction phase as fast as possible
because money is so expensive. shortages of labor and material do
cause defaults and delays but rising costs permit mortgage trusts to
liquidate their commitments without loss.
money is tight and alternative sources of interim financing are
in short supply. investor recognition of the mortgage trust concept
has progressed far enough to permit the formation of new trusts
and the rapid expansion of existing ones. the self-reinforcing pro-
cess gets under way.
act two: if and when inflation abates, the effective yield on con-
struction loans will decline. on the other hand, there will be a
housing boom and bank credit will be available at advantageous
rates. with higher leverage, the rate of return on equity can be
maintained despite a lower effective yield. with a growing market
and growing investor recognition, the premium over book value
may continue to increase. mortgage trusts are likely to take full
advantage of the premium and show a rapid rise in both size and
per-share earnings. since entry into the field is unrestricted, the
number of mortgage trusts will also increase.
act three: the self-reinforcing process will continue until mort-
gage trusts have captured a significant part of %he construction loan
market. increasing competition will then force them to take greater
risks. construction activity itself will have become more specula-
tive and bad loans will increase. eventually, the housing boom will
slacken off and housing surpluses will appear in various parts of
the country, accompanied by a slack real estate market and tem-
porary declines in real estate prices. at this point, some of the
mortgage trusts will be bound to have a large number of delinquent
loans in their portfolios and the banks will panic and demand that
their lines of credit be paid off.
act four: investor disappointment will affect the valuation of the
group, and a lower premium coupled with slower growth will in

reflexivity in the stock market 63

turn reduce the per-share earnings progression. the multiple will
decline and the group will go through a shakeout period. after the
shakeout, the industry will have attained maturity: there will be
few new entries, regulations may be introduced, and existing trusts
will settle down to a more moderate growth.
,
i
evaluation i
the shakeout is a ldng time away. before it occurs, mortgage
trusts will have grown manifold in size and mortgage trust shares
will have shown tremendous gains. it is not a danger that should
deter investors at the p~esent time.
the only real danger at present is that the self-reinforcing pro-
cess may not get under way at all. in a really serious stock mamet
decline investors may be unwilling to pay any premium even for a
12% return on equity. we doubt that such conditions would arise;
we are more inclined to expect an environment in which a 12%
return is more exceptional than it has been recently and in which
the self-reinforcing processes of the last few years, notably con-
glomerates and computer leasing companies, are going through
their shakeout period. in such an environment there should be
enough money available for a self-reinforcing process which is just
starting, especially if it is the only game in town.
'"if the process fails to get under way, investors would find down-
side protection in the book value. the new trusts are coming to the
market at book value plus underwriting commission (usually 10%).
most recently formed trusts are selling at a premium which is still
modest. it will be recalled that when their assets 3fe fully em-
ployed in interim loans, mortgage trusts can earn 11% on their
book without leverage and 12% with a 1:l leverage. a modest
premium over book value would seem justified even in the absence
of growth.
if the self-reinforcing process does get under way, shareholders
in well-managed mortgage trusts should enjoy the compound ben-
efits of a high return on equity, a rising book value, and a rising
premium over book value for the next few years. the capital gains
potential is of the same order of magnitude as at the beginning of
other self-reinforcing processes in recent stock market history.

my report had an interesting history. it came at a time when go-
go fund managers had suffered severe losses in the collapse of the
conglomerates. since they were entitled to share in the profits but
did not have to share in the losses of the funds they managed,

64 theory
they were inclined to grasp at anything that held out the pros-
pect of a quick profit. they instinctively understood how a self-
i reinforcing process works since they had just participated in one
and they were anxious to play. the report found a tremendous
response whose extent i realized only when i received a telephone
call from a bank in cleveland asking for a new copy because theirs
had gone through so many xerox incarnations that it was no
longer legible. there were only a few mortgage trusts in existence
at the time but the shares were so eagerly sought after that they
nearly doubled in price in the space of a month or so. demand
generated supply and there was a flood of new issues coming to
market. when it became clear that the stream of new mortgage
trusts was inexhaustible, prices fell almost as rapidly as they had
gone up. obviously the readers of the report failed to take into
4 account the ease of entry and their mistake was corrected in short
order. nevertheless their enthusiastic reception helped to get the
self-reinforcing process described in the report under way. sub-
sequent events took the course outlined in the report. mortgage
trust shares enjoyed a boom that was not as violent as the one that
followed the publication of the report but turned out to be more
enduring.
i had invested heavily in mortgage trusts and took some profits
when the reception of my study exceeded my expectations. but i
was sufficiently carried away by my own success to be caught in
the downdraft with a significant inventory. i hung on and even
increased my positions. i followed the industry closely for a year
or so and sold my holdings with good profits. then i lost touch
with the group until a few years later when problems began to
surface. i was tempted to establish a short pcsitioo but was hand-
icapped in that i was no longer famiiiar with the terrain. never-
theless, when i reread the report i had written several years
earlier, i was persuaded by my own prediction. i decided to sell
the group short more or less indiscriminately. moreover, as the
shares fell i maintained the same level of exposure by selling
additional shares short. my original prediction was fulfilled and
most reits went broke. the result was that 1 reaped more than
100% profit on my short positions-a seeming impossibility since
the maximum profit on a short position is 100%. (the explanation
is that i kept on selling additional shares.)
self-reinforcinghelf-defeating cycles like the conglomerate
boom and the reits do not occur every day. there are long fallow

reflexivity in the stock market 65
periods when the specialist in such cycles remains unemployed.
he need not starve, however. the divergence between underlying
trends and investor recognition persists at all times and the astute
investor can take advantage of it. new industries arise, or old ones
come back into favor. 'typically, they are inadequately followed
at first. for instance, when defense spending started to rise in the
early 1970s after a long decline, there were only two or three
analysts left who follbwed the industry, although it still repre-
sented a substantial portion of the economy. those who were left
were too demoralized to recognize the beginning of a major new
trend. that was a wqnderful time to invest in defense stocks.
there were high-tech fiefense stocks that had never been visited
by an analyst, like e-systems, inc., and well-established compa-
nies that had fallen on evil days trying to diversify out of defense,
like sanders associates, or getting caught up in scandals trying to
sell airplanes through bribery, like northrop and lockheed.
in the case of defense stocks, there was no self-reinforcing pro-
cess involved but investor recognition certainly helped the price
of the stocks. actually, it is a rare case where the investors' bias
leaves the fundamentals totally unaffected. even with defense
stocks the prevailing bias played a role, but it was a negative one.
lockheed had to be bailed out by the government and companies
like sanders associates had to restructure.their debt by offering
conver$ble bonds at prices that turned out to be very low in
retrospect. only when the negative bias was corrsted was there
very little further feedback: companies had little need for addi-
tional capital, and managements, having been burned once before,
were leery of diversifying out of defense. there were exceptions,
like united aircraft, but investnrs' bias never turned positive
enough to allow a self-reinforcing process to get under way: many
of united aircraft's acquisitions were for cash and those that in-
volved stock did not enhance earnings significantly. the result
was a larger, diversified company, but no boom and bust in the
stock.
perhaps the most interesting case of negative bias occurred in
technology stocks. after the stock market debacle of 1974, inves-
tors were leery of any company that needed to raise equity capital
from outside sources. distributed data processing was in the early
stages of its development. new companies like datapoint and
four-phase were in the vanguard with ibm lagging badly. the
market was practically exploding but these little companies were

66 theory
hamstrung by their inability to raise capital. the stocks were sell-
, ing at very low multiples of anticipated earnings and the main
argument against them was that they would not be able to grow
fast enough to meet the demand and eventually ibm would move
into the market. the argument turned out to be valid, but not
before these companies became large and prosperous and inves-
tors became eager to throw money at them at high multiples.
those who had been willing to fight the negative bias were amply
rewarded.
as the various niches occupied by these small companies con-
verged to form a large market, most of them were absorbed by
larger companies and thase that stayed independent fel1 on evil
days. datapoint is currently looking for a home at a much reduced
multiple. four-phase was recently acquired by motorola, which
4 proceeded to lose its shirt on it. if the initial market reaction to
distributed data-processing companies had been more positive, it
is possible that some of the early starters might have grown fast
enough to survive, just as the earlier wave of microcomputer man-
ufacturers did spawn a few enduring companies like digital
equipment and data general.
the negative bias of the 1975-1976 period gave way to the
opposite extreme. it found expression in a venture capital boom
that culminated in the second quarter of the sequence of
1983.
events is not as clear cut as in the case of reits, but that is only
because high technology is not as homogeneous an industry. the
same reflexive interaction between stock prices, prevailing bias,
and fundamentals can be observed but much more specific
knowledge is required to trace the course of events.
the availability of venture capital on altiticti.~e terms led to a
proliferation of new ventures. every new company needed equip-
ment, as well as inventory, so that electronic equipment manufac-
turers enjoyed a boom, and so did the manufacturers of products
and components. the electronics industry is a large customer of
its own products so that the boom was self-reinforcing. but the
proliferation of companies intensified competition. industry lead-
ers lost their market position as a new generation of products was
introduced because the individuals who were responsible for de-
veloping them left their companies and set up new ones. instead
of companies growing in step with their industry, the industry
grew by the multiplication of companies. investors failed to rec-
ognize this trend; as a result, technology stocks in general and
new issues in particular became substantially overvalued.

reflexivity in the stock market 67
the new issue boom culminated in the second quarter of 1983.
when prices started to decline, fewer issues could be sold and
eventually venture capitalists became less venturesome. as fewer
companies were formed and the existing ones depleted their cash,
the market for technqlogy products softened. competition inten-
sified and profit margins deteriorated. the process started to feed
on itself and the low point has probably still not been reached.*
the venture capital boom was not the only cause of the subse-
quent shakeout-the strong dollar and the rise of japanese com-
petition were at least as important-but it is clear that stock
prices had an impact bn the "fundamentals" in both directions.
what distinguishes' the conglomeldie and mxt sequznces from
the venture capital boom is that in the first two cases the under-
lying trend itself was based on the exploitation of the investors'
bias while in the third it was not. in the case of conglomerates the
idea was to acquire other companies with inflated paper; in the
case of reits the idea was equity leveraging. the idea behind the
latest generation of technology products had nothing to do with
the stock market.
to understand the ups and downs of technology stocks we
must know something about the underlying trends in technology;
in the case of conglomerates and mits we need to know little
else than the theory of reflexivity.
it is important to realize, however, that knowing everything
about underlying trends in technology is not sufikient to explain
the ups and downs of technology stocks: the reflexive interaction
between underlying trends, prevailing biases, and stock prices
also needs to be understood. combining the two kinds of under-
standifig is extremely difficult. those who want to be familis
with technology must follow the industry closely and continu-
ously; those who want to exploit the divergence between percep-
tion and reality must move from group to group. most technology
experts are ignorant of reflexivity and tend to remain fully in-
vested at all times. their popularity and influence wax and wane
in a reflexive fashion. after the recent decline in technology
stocks, a new breed of analysts seems to be emerging who are
overly sensitive to the importance of investors' perceptions. after
a decent interval it may be once again profitable to go against the
prevailing bias and invest in technology stocks on the basis of
fundamental trends.

i have always had a lot of difficulty investing in technology
4 stocks because of the specialized knowledge required. finally, i
managed to gain a good insight into the computer industry during
the 1975-1976 period and profited from the prevailing negative
bias. i held on to my positions for a few years but then i sold them
and lost my grip on the industry. in 1981 i made the mistake of
not participating in a venture capital fund operated by one of the
most successful venture capitalists of the period in the belief that
the boom could not last long enough to allow investors to exit in
time. in this, i was undoubtedly influenced by misgivings about
the larger picture. in any event, his investors realized a good profit

stocks and the boom passed me by.
t even the conglomerate and reit sequences were not totally
self-contained. extraneous developments, such as the level of
economic activity, regulation, or sgcific events (e.g., the at-
tempted takeover of chemical bank), played a crucial role in the
conglomerate boom. in less "pure" sequences the importance of
outside influences is even peafer.
we are currently in the midst of another self-reinforcinglself-
defeating cycle that will go down in history as the mergermania
of the 1980s. instead of inflated paper, it is cash that serves as the
currency. the scale of transactions already dwarfs the conglom-
erate boom. mergermania is but an element in a much larger on-
going historical drama whose ramifications reach far beyond the
stock market and involve politics, exchange rates, monetary and
fiscal policies, quirks of taxation, international capital move-
ments, and many other developments.
i shali m ~ k ean attempt at unraveling the ongoing historical
drama, but that is not as simple as analyzing a more or less self-
contained boombust sequence. the larger picture is full of reflex-
ive interactions as well as nonreflexive fundamental trends. we
need a more complex model that allows for the transition from
one boombust sequence to another and for the coexistence of
several reflexive processes at the same time.
before i embark on such an ambitious project, i want to exam-
ine another market that is characterized by vicious and benign
circles: the currency market.

reflexnity in the currency
i market*

while reflexive interactions are intermittent in the stock market,
they are continuous in the market for currencies. i shall try to
show that freely floating exchange rates are inherently unstable;
moreover, the instability is cumulative so that the eventual break-
down of a freely floqting exchange rate system is virtually as-
sured.
the traditional view of the currency market is that it tends
toward equilibrium. an overvalued exchange rat&courages im-
ports and discourages exports until equilibrium is reestablished.
similarly, an improvement in competitive position is reflected in
an appreciating exchange rate that reduces the trade surplus so
that equilibrium is again reestablished. speculation cannot dis-
rupt the trend toward equilibrium-if speculators anticipate the
future correctly, they accelerate the trend; if they misjudge it, they
will be penalized by the underlying trend that may be delayed
but will inexorably assert itself.
experience since floating exchange rates were introduced in
1973 has disproved this view. instead of fundamentals determin-
ing exchange rates, exchange rates have found a way of influenc-
ing the fundamentals. for instance, a strong exchange rate
discourages inflation: wages remain stable and the price of im-
ports falls. when exports have a large import component, a coun-
try can remain competitive almost indefinitely in spite of a steady

appreciation of its currency, as germany demonstrated in the
i 1970s.
the fact is that the relationship between the domestic inflation
rate and the international exchange rate is not unidirectional but
circular. changes in one may precede changes in the other, but it
does not make sense to describe one as the cause and the other as
the effect because they mutually reinforce each other. it is more
appropriate to speak of a vicious circle in which the currency
depreciates and inflation accelerates or of a benign circle where
the opposite happens.
vicious and benign circles are a far cry from equilibrium.
neverthepsss, they could produce a state of affairs akin to equi-
librium if the reflexive, mutually self-reinforcing relationship
t could be sustained indefinitely. but that is not the case. the
self-reinforcing process tends to become more vulnerable the
longer it lasts and eventually it is bound to reverse itself, setting
in motion a self-reinforcing process in the opposite direction.
a complete cycle is characterized by wide fluctuations not
only in the exchange rate but also in interest rates, inflation,
andlor the level of economic activity.
the participants' bias introduces an element of instability into
the system. if the system had an innate tendency toward equilib-
rium the participants' bias could not disrupt it; at worst, it could
introduce some random, short-term fluctuations. but when the
causal connections are reflexive, the participants' bias may engen-
der, sustain, or destroy a vicious or benign circle. moreover, the
prevailing bias takes on a life of its own as one of the constituent
parts in a circular relationship. it finds expression in spec~lative
capital movements that may serve as a counterweight to an imbal-
ance in trade, allowing a trade surplus or deficit to exceed, both
in size and in duration, the level that could have been sustained
in its absence. when that happens speculation becomes a desta-
bilizing influence.
international capital movements tend to follow a self-reinforc-
inglself-defeating pattern similar to the one we identified in the
stock market. but the model we used for stock price movements
cannot be applied to currency markets without substantial modi-
fications. in the stock market we focused on the reflexive relation-
ship between two variables: stock prices and a single underlying
trend. we were trying to build the simplest possible model and
we were willing to simplify a much more complex reality to serve

reflexivity in the currency market 7 1
our purpose. in the currency market we cannot get by with two
variables; even the simplest model will need seven or eight. we
have selected four rates and four quantities, namely:

4

nominal exchange iate (number of foreign currency units for one
domestic currency unit; t e = strengthening)
nominal interest rake
domestic versus foreign price level ( p = increase in domestic
prices faster than in foreign prices and vice versa)
level of economic activity
nonspeculative capital. f l ~ w
speculative capital flow = increased inflow
trade balance t = surplus
government budget 5. = deficit

our task is to establtsh how these variables relate to each other.
we shall not attempt to explore all the relationships but only
those that are necessary to build simple models. in other words,
we are not aiming at a general theory, only at a partial explanation
of currency movements. our focus is the exchange rate and we
bring in the other variables only when we need them. we shall
not quantify any of the variables but only indicate direction
( , 5. ) or order of magnitude (>, <). a
before we start, two general observations can be made. one is
that relationships tend to be circular; that is, variables can serve
as both cause and effect in relation to other variables. we shall
denote the causal connection by 2 horizcntal =ow (+j. the other
point is that the relationship of .the variables need not be inter-
nally conastent; it is the inconsistencies that make that entire
situation move in a certain direction, creating vicious or benign
circles. equilibrium would require internal consistency; histori-
cal change does not. describing historical change in terms of vi-
cious and benign circles is, of course, merely a figure of speech.
a circular movement between component parts when the entire
system is in motion could also be described as a spiral. moreover,
what is benign and what is vicious are in the eye of the beholder.
exchange rates are determined by the demand and supply of
currencies. for present purposes, we can group the various factors
that constitute demand and supply under three headings: trade,
nonspeculative capital transactions, and speculative capital

72 theory
transactions. this gives us the simplest model of a freely floating
4 exchange rate system:

in other words, the sum of the currency transactions under the
three headings determines the direction of the exchange rate.
our primary interest is in investigating the role that the partic-
ipants' bias plays in exchange rate movements. to facilitate the
investigation, we shall assume that the bias finds expression only
in speculative capital transactions (s], while lise (?f and non-
speculative capital flows (n) are independent of expectations:
they constitute the "fundamentals." in reality, the "fundamen-
4 tals" are also influenced by the participants' expectations about
the future course of 'exchange rates. trade figures are notoriously
distorted by leads and lags in payment, not to mention the effect
of expectations on the inventory policy of exporters and import-
ers. as far as capital movements are concerned, perhaps the only
transaction that is totally independent of expectations is the pay-
ment of interest on accumulated debt; the reinvestment of interest
receipts already qualifies as a speculative transaction. the repa-
triation of bank debt from less developed countries is probably
best described as nonspeculative, although speculative consider-
ations come into play if and when the assets are redeployed. what
about direct investment? if managements were interested only in
the total rate of return, it ought to be classified as speculative, but
often there are overriding industrial considerations. it can be seen
that there are many gradations betwee3 speculative and nonspe-
culative transactions; but we do not do any great violence to real-
ity by putting them into these two broad categories.
we shall focus on speculative capital transactions because that
is where the participants' bias finds expression. speculative cap-
ital moves in search of the highest total return. total return has
three elements: the interest rate differential, the exchange rate
differential, and the capital appreciation in local currency. since
the third element varies from case to case we can propose the
following general rule: speculative capital is attracted by rising
exchange rates and rising interest rates.

reflexivity in the currency market 73
of the two, exchange rates are by far the more important. it does
not take much of a decline in the currency to render the total
return negative. by the same. token, when an appreciating cur-
rency also offers an interest rate advantage, the total return ex-
ceeds anything that alholder of financial assets could expect in
the normal course of events.
that is not to say tbat interest rate differentials are unimpor-
tant; but much of their importance lies in their effect on exchange
rates and that depends on the participants' perceptions. there are
times when relative interest rates seem to be a major influence; at
other times they are totally disregarded. for instance, from 1982
to 1986 capital was artacted to the currency with the 2.-,i&est
interest rate, namely, the dollar, but in the late 1970s switzerland
could not arrest the influx of capital even by imposing negative
interest rates. moreover, perceptions about the importance of in-
terest rates are often bong. for instance, until november 1984
the strength of the dollar was widely attributed to high interest
rates in the united states. when interest rates declined without
the dollar weakening this view was discredited and the dollar
went through the roof.
expectations about' exchange rates play the same role in cur-
rency markets as expectations about stock prices do in the stock
market: they constitute the paramount consideration for those
who are motivated by the total rate of return. in the stock market
that covers practically all investors, in currency markets all spec-
ulative transactions.
in the stock market we used a model that focused on stock
prices and disregarded dividend income. no great distortion was
involved because in the kind of boom/"busf sequences we were
considering stock price movements far outweigh dividend in-
come. similar conditions prevail in currency markets: expecta-
tions about future exchange rates constitute the main motivation
in speculative capital transactions. .
the major difference between the stock market and the cur-
rency market seems to be the role played by the fundamentals.
we have seen that the "fundamentals" were rather nebulous even ,
in the case of stocks but at least we had no reason to doubt that
stock prices were somehow connected to the fundamentals. in the
case of currencies the trade balance is clearly the most important
fundamental factor, yet the dollar strengthened between 1982 and
1985 while the trade balance of the united states was deteriorat-

74 theory
ing. it would seem that the fundamentals are even less relevant in
4 determining price trends than in the stock market. we do not
need to look far afield for an explanation: it is to be found in the
relative importance of speculative capital movements.
as we have seen, speculative capital is motivated primarily by
expectations about future exchange rates. to the extent that ex-
change rates are dominated by speculative capital transfers, they
are purely reflexive: expectations relate to expectations and the
prevailing bias can validate itself almost indefinitely. the situa-
tion is highly unstable: if the opposite bias prevailed, it could also
validate itself. the greater the relative importance of speculation,
+$he more unstable the system becomes: the total rate of return can
flip-flop with every change in the prevailing bias.
t in our discussion of the stock market we identified certain se-
quences such as the conglomerate boom where the prevailing bias
formed an important part of the underlying trend, but we con-
cluded that such pure m p l e s of reflexivity are exceptional. by
contrast, in a system of freely fluctuating exchange rates reflexiv-
ity constitutes the rule. of course, there is no such thing as a
purely reflexive situation. speculation is only one of the factors
that determine exchange rates and the other factors must also be
taken into account in formulating one's expectations. thus, ex-
pectations cannot be totally capricious: they must be rooted in
something other than themselves. how a prevailing bias becomes
established and, even more important, how it is reversed are the
most important questions confronting us.
there are no universally valid answers. reflexive processes
tend to follow a certain pattern. in the early stages, the trend has
.to be self-reinforcing, otherwise the process aborts. as the trend
extends, it becomes increasingly vulnerable because the funda-
mentals such as trade and interest payments move against the
trend, in accordance with the precepts of classical analysis, and
the trend becomes increasingly dependent on the prevailing bias.
eventually a turning point is reached and, in a full-fledged se-
quence, a self-reinforcing process starts operating in the opposite
direction.
within this general pattern each sequence is unique. it is the
characteristic feature of a reflexive process that neither the partic-
ipants' perceptions nor the situation to which they relate remain
unaffected by it. it follows that no sequence can repeat itself. not
even the variables that interact in a circular fashion need be the

reflexivity in the currency market 75
same; certainly they will not carry the same weight on different
occasions.
we have had two major reflexive moves in the dollar since the
breakdown of the bretton woods system and at least that many in
sterling. it it instructive to compare the two big moves in the
dollar because the interaction between the trade balance and cap-
ital movements was rqically different in the two instances.
in the late 1970s the dollar got progressively weaker, especially
against the continental currencies, while in the 1980s it got pro-
gressively stronger. we shall call the first move carter's vicious
circle and the second reagan's benign circle. we can build simple
models to show how differeni the two trends were.
in the case of germany in the late 1970s, the german mark was
strong ( f e). speculative purchases played a major role in making
it stronger ( j. s) and sustaining the benign circle. germany started
with a trade surplus and the strength of the currency helped to
keep the price level down. since exports had a large import con-
tent the real exchangq rate, as opposed to the nominal, remained
more or less stable (fep) and the effect on the trade balance was
negligible (it). with +e speculative inflow predominating ( j. s >
ft), the benign circle was self-reinforcing:

the fact that the rate of currency appreciation exmded the inter-
est rate differential made it very profitable to hold german marks,
so that the speculative inflow was both self-reinforcing and self-
validating.
'what was a benign circle for germany was a vicious circie for
the united states. as the exchange rate depreciated, inflation ac-
celerated. despite rising nominal interest rates, real rates re-
mained very low, if not negative. various measures were tried to
compensate for the outflow of capital, of which the issue of so-
called carter bonds denominated in german marks and swiss
francs was the most dramatic, but nothing seemed to work until
the federal reserve embraced a strict monetarist policy. then
came the election of ronald reagan to the presidency and the
dollar embarked on a sustained rise.
during reagan's benign circle the strong dollar caused a sharp
deterioration in the trade balance of the united states. in contrast
to germany in the late 1970s, the united states did not have a

trade surplus to start with. moreover, the appreciation in the cur-
i rency was not matched by inflation rate differentials. the infla-
tion rate declined in the united states but it remained low in
other countries as well. as a consequence, the united states de-
veloped an unprecedented trade deficit as well as an unprece-
dented interest rate differential in favor of the dollar. it was
extremely attractive to hold dollars as long as the dollar remained
firm, and the dollar remained firm as long as the deficit on current
account was fully matched by a surplus on capital account. in our
notation:

the models are obviously oversimplified. we shall explore rea-
gan's benign circle in greater depth later. the point we are trying
to make here is that different sequences have totally different
structures. in the case of germany in the late 1970s the apprecia-
tion of the currency was sustained by the inflation rate differential
and the balance of trade was largely unaffected. reagan's benign
circle was sustained by a differential in interest rates rather than
inflation rates and there was an ever-growing trade deficit which
was matched by an ever-growing inflow of capital. while in the
first case it was possible to claim some kind of equilibrium, in the
second case the disequilibrium was palpable. the inflow of capi-
tal depended on a strong dollar and a strong dollar depended on
an ever-rising inflow of capital which carried with it ever-rising
interest and repayment obligations ( t n). it was obvious that the
benign circle could not be sustained indefinitely. yet, while it
iasted, any cummcy speculator who dared to fight the trend had
to pay dearly for it. speculation did not serve to reestablish equi-
librium. on the contrary, it reinforced the trend and thereby in-
creased the disequilibrium, which would eventually have to be
.
corrected. .
although each self-reinforcing circle is unique, we can make
some universally valid generalizations about freely fluctuating
exchange rates. first, the relative importance of speculative trans-
actions tends to increase during the lifetime of a self-reinforcing
trend. second, the prevailing bias is a trend-following one and
the longer the trend persists, the stronger the bias becomes. the
third is simply that once a trend is established it tends to persist
and to run its full course; when the turn finally comes, it tends to

reflexivity in the currency market 7 7
set into motion a self-reinforcing process in the opposite direc-
tion. in other words, currencies tend to move in large waves, with
each move lasting several years.
these three tendencies are mutually self-validating. it is the
growth in speculative ;capital flows moving in a trend-following
fashion that makes the trend so persistent; it is the persistence of
the trend that makes a trend-following bias so rewarding; and it
is the rewards reaped by speculation that attract increasing
amounts of capital.
the longer a benign circle lasts, the more attractive it is to hold
financial assets in the appreciating currency and the more impor-
tant the exchange rate'becomes in calculating total return. those
who are inclined to fight the trend are progressively eliminated
and in the end only trend followers survive as active participants.
as speculation gains in importance, other factors lose their influ-
ence. there is nothing to guide speculators but the market itself,
and the market is dominated by trend followers. these consider-
ations explain how thk dollar could continue to appreciate in the
face of an ever-rising trade deficit. eventually, a crossover point
would have been reached, even without the intervention of the
authorities, when the inflow of speculative funds could not keep
pace with the trade deficit and with rising interest obligations,
and the trend would have been reversed. since the predominating
bias is trend following, speculative capital would then have
started moving in the opposite direction. if and %en that hap-
pened, the reversal could easily have accelerated into a free fall.
for one thing, speculation and "fundamental" flows would then
have worked in the same direction. even more important, when a
change in trend is recognized, the volume of speculative transae-
tions is likely to undergo a dramatic, not to say catastrophic,
increase. while a trend persists, speculative flows are incremen-
tal; but a reversal involves not only the current flow but also the
accumulated stock of speculative capital. the longer the trend
has persisted, the larger the accumulation. there are, of course,
mitigating circumstances. one is that market participants are
likely to recognize a change in trend only gradually. the other is
that the authorities are bound to be aware of the danger and do
something to prevent a crash. how the drama actually unfolded
will be the subject of a later chapter. here we are trying to estab-
lish a general proposition.
taking the three generalizations together, it can be asserted that

78 theory
speculation is progressively destabilizing. the destabilizing effect
i arises not because the speculative capital flows must be even-
tually reversed but exactly because they need not be reversed
until much later. if they had to be reversed in short order, capital
transactions would provide a welcome cushion for making the
adjustment process less painful. if they need not be reversed, the
participants get to depend on them so that eventually when the
turn comes the adjustment becomes that much more painful.
it is quite likely that the generalization about the progressive
accumulation of hot money holds true not only within a cycle but
also from one cycle to another, although the history of fluctuating
exchange rates is too short to provide reliable evidence. it has
certainly been true so far-the size of speculative capital move-
i ments was far greater in reagan's benign circle than it was during
carter's vicious circle. empirical studies of the 1930s also showed
a cumulative growth in "hot money" movements,' although cir-
cumstances were somewhat different because currencies were not
freely floating.
we can see why hot money should continue to accumulate as
long as real interest rates are high and the return on physical
investments low: keeping capital in liquid fonn in an appreciat;
ing currency is more rewarding than investing it in physical as-
sets. what is needed to give the generalization universal validity
is an argument that would show that fluctuating exchange rates
are associated with high returns on financial assets and low re-
turns on physical investments. let me try. we have seen that hot
money can earn exceptional returns if it gets the trend right; since
it sets the trend, that is likely to be the case. physical assets rep-
resent the opposite side of the coin: they cannot move to take
advantage of the trend. the tradable goods sector is bound to
suffer when a currency appreciates. of course, a depreciating cur-
rency brings windfall profits to exporters, but having been hurt
before, exporters are loath to invest on the basis of a temporary
advantage: they prefer to hold their profits in financial assets,
contributing to the growth of hot money. the process can be most
clearly observed in the united kingdom, where exporters refused
to expand when sterling fell below $1.10 in 1985, despite record
profits. how right they were! sterling rose above $1.50 by april
1986. thus, both an appreciating currency and a depreciating
currency discourage physical investment and foster the accumu-
lation of "hot money."

reflexivity in the currency market 79
we can attempt yet banother tentative generalization. when a
long-term trend loses its momentum, short-term volatility tends
to rise. it is easy to see why that should be so: the trend-following
crowd is disoriented. the generalization is tentative because it is
based on inadequate evidence. it certainly was true when the
dollar reversed its trend in 1985.2
if these generalizations are indeed valid, the eventual demise of
a system of freely fluctuating exchange rates is inevitable. fluc-
tuations become so wild that either the system has to be modified
by some kind of government intervention or it is bound to break
down. currency markets thus provide the best support for my
contention that financial markets are inherently unstable. there
is no built-in tendency toward equilibrium: to the extent that we
need stability we must introduce it by deliberate policy measures.

olutionary at the present time, but they certainly contradicted the
prevailing wisdom at ,the time they were written in aprilt'ay

came as something of a shock to market participants. even today,
there is no theoretical underpinning for the contention that a

, as a practical test of the theory propounded here. admittedly the
theory is far too abstract to be of much use in making concrete
predictions. specifically, the turning point cannot be determined
until it has actually occurred. but, as we shall see, the theory can
be very useful in interpreting events as they unfold.

the credlt ahw regulatory cycle *

there seems to be a special affinity between reflexivity and credit.
that is hardly surprising: credit depends on expectations; expec-
tations involve bias; hdnce credit is one of the main avenues that
permit bias to play a causal role in the course of events. but there
is more to it. credit seems to be associated with a particular kind
of reflexive pattern that is known as boom and bust. the pattern
is asymmetrical: the boom is drawn out and accelerates gradually;
the bust is sudden and often catastrophic. by contrast, when
credit is not an essential ingredient in a reflexitlreprocess, the
pattern tends to be more symmetrical. for instance, in the cur-
rency market it does not seem to make much difference whether
the dollar is rising or falling: the exchange rate seems to follow a
wavelike pattern.
i believe the asymmetry arises out of a reflexive connection
between loan and collateral. in this context i give collateral a very
broad definition: it will denote whatever determines the credit-
worthiness of a debtor, whether it is actually pledged or not. it
may mean a piece of property or an expected future stream of
income; in either case, it is something on which the lender is
willing to place a value. valuation is supposed to be a passive
relationship in which the value reflects the underlying asset; but
in this case it involves a positive act: a loan is made. the act of
lending may affect the collateral value: that is the connection that
gives rise to a reflexive process.

82 theory
it will be recalled that we have analyzed reflexivity as two con-
nections working in opposite directions: the "normal" connec-
tion where a value is placed on future events, as in the stock
market or banking-we have called it the cognitive function; and
a "perverse" connection in which expectations affect that which
is expected-we have called it the participating function. the
participating function is perverse because its effect is not always
felt, and when it does operate its influence is so difficult to dis-
entangle that it tends to go unrecognized. the prevailing view of
how financial markets operate tends to leave the participating
function out of account. for instance, in the international lending
boom, bankers did not recognize that the debt ratios olr borrowing
countries were favorably influenced by their own lending activ-
ity. in the conglomerate boom, investors did not realize that per-
share earnings growth can be affected by the valuation they place
on it. at present, most people do not realize that the erosion of
collateral values can depress the economy.
the act of lending usually stimulates economic activity. it en-
ables the borrower to consume more than he would otherwise, or
to invest in productive assets. there are exceptions, to be sure: if
the assets in question are not physical but financial ones, the
effect is not necessarily stimulative. by the same token, debt ser-
vice has a depressing impact. resources that would otherwise be
devoted to consumption or the creation of a future stream of in-
come are withdrawn. as the total amount of debt outstanding
accumulates, the portion that has to be utilized for debt service
increases. it is only net new lending that stimulates, and total
new lending has to keep rising in order to keep net new lending
stable.
the connection between lending and economic activity is far
from straightforward (that is, in fact, the best justification for the
monetarists' preoccupation with money supply, to the neglect of
credit). the major difficulty is that credit need not be involved in
the physical production or consumption of goods and services; it
may be used for purely financial purposes. in this case, its influ-
ence on economic activity becomes problematic. for purposes of
this discussion it may be helpful to distinguish between a "real"
economy and a "financial" economy. economic activity takes
place in the "real" economy, while the extension and repayment
of credit occur in the "financial" economy. the reflexive interac-
tion between the act of lending and the value of the collateral may

the credit and regulatory cycle 83
then connect the "real" and the "financial" economy or it may be
confined to the "financitil" economy. here we shall focus on the
first case.
a strong economy tends to enhance the asset values and income
streams that serve to determine creditworthiness. in the early
stages of a reflexive prdcess of credit expansion the amount of
credit involved is relatively small so that its impact on collateral
values is negligible. thdt is why the expansionary phase is slow
to start with and credit remains soundly based at first. but as the
amount of debt accumulates, total lending increases in impor-
tance and begins to have an appreciable effect on collateral val-
ues. the process continves until a point is reached where total
credit cannot increase fast enough to continue stimulating the
economy. by that time, collateral values have become greatly de-
pendent on the stimulative effect of new lending and, as new
lending fails to accelerate, collateral values begin to decline. the
erosion of collateral values has a depressing effect on economic
activity, which in turn reinforces the erosion of collateral values.
since the collateral has'been pretty fully utilized at that point, a
decline may precipitate the liquidation of loans, which in turn
may make the decline more precipitous. that is the anatomy of a '
typical boom and bust.
booms and busts are not symmetrical because, at the inception
of a boom, both the volume of credit and the value of the collateral
are at a minimum; at the time of the bust, both are a p maximum.
but there is another factor at play. the liquidation of loans takes
time; the faster it has to be accomplished, the greater the effect on
the value of the collateral. in a bust, the reflexive interaction be-
tween loans and collateral becomes compr~ssed within a very
short time frame and the consequences can be catastrophic. it is
the sudden liquidation of accumulated positions that gives a bust
such a different shape from the preceding boom.
it can be seen that the boomhust sequence is a particular var-
iant of reflexivity. booms can arise whenever there is a two-way
connection between values and the act of valuation. the act of
valuation takes many forms. in the stock market, it is equity that
is valued; in banking, it is collateral. it is possible, although un-
likely, that a boom could be generated without any credit expan-
sion. the two examples we studied in the stock market, the reit
and conglomerate booms, could, in theory, have unfolded with-
out the stocks being used as collateral, although in practice there

84 theory
was a lot of credit involved. in the absence of credit the reversal
t would be a more gradual process. the contraction would not be a
mirror image of the expansion for the reason mentioned earlier-
the reflexive element in valuations is greater at the time of rever-
sal than at the inception of a trend-but the compression that is
characteristic of busts would be absent.
both the boodust pattern and its explanation are almost too
obvious to be interesting. the amazing thing is that the reflexive
connection between lending and collateral has not been generally
recognized. there is an enormous literature on the trade cycle,
but i have not seen much awareness of the reflexive relationship
described here. moreover, the trade cycles that-are gemrally dis-
cussed in textbooks differ in duration from the credit cycle i am
discussing here: they are short-tenn fluctuations within a larger
t pattern. there is an awareness of a larger cycle, usually referred
to as the kondratieff wave,-but it has never been "scientifically"
explained. at present, there is much concern that we may be
approaching another recession but the general assumption is that
we are dealing with a recession just like any other; the fact that
we are in the declining phase of the larger cycle is usually left out
of account. i contend that all previous recessions since the end of
world war 11 occurred while credit was expanding, while the one
we may or may not be facing now would occur when borrowing
capacity in the real economy is contracting. this creates a situa-
tion that has no precedent in recent history.
exactly where we are in the larger cycle is difficult to deter-
mine. i must confess i have been confused on the issue since 1982.
the reason for my confusion is that while the boom has clearly
' sun out of steam, the bust has not taken place.
busts can be very disruptive, especially if the liquidation of
collateral causes a sudden compression of credit. the conse-
quences are so unpleasant that strenuous efforts are made to avoid
them. the institution of central banking has evolved in a continu-
ing attempt to prevent sudden, catastrophic contractions in
credit. since a panic is hard to arrest once it has started, preven-
tion is best practiced in the expansionary phase. that is why the
role of central banks has gradually expanded to include the regu-
lation of the money supply. that is also why organized financial
markets regulate the ratio of collateral to credit.
until now, the authorities have been able to prevent a bust. we
find ourselves in a twilight zone where the "normal" process of

the credit and regulatory cycle 85
credit expansion culminated long ago but the "normal" process
of credit contraction has been prevented by the authorities. we
are in uncharted territory because the actions of the authorities
have no precedent.
the fact that banks and organized financial markets are regu-
lated complicates the course of events tremendously. financial
history is best interpreted as a reflexive process in which there
are two sets of participants instead of one: competitors and regu-
lators.
such a system is much more complex than the case we studied
in the stock market. there, the regulatory environment was more
or less fixed: it was the backdrop against which the drama was
acted out. here, the regulatory environment is an integral part of
the process.
~t is important to realize that-the regulators are also partici-
pants. there is a natural tendency to regard them as superhuman
beings who somehow stand outside and above the economic pro-
cess and intervene only when the participants have made a mess
of it. that is not the case. they also are human, all too human.
they operate with imperfect understanding and their activities
have unintended consequences. indeed, they seem to adjust to
changing circumstances less well than those who are motivated
by profit and loss, so that regulations are generally designed to
prevent the last mishap, not the next one. the deficiencies of
regulation tend to be more noticeable when conditi~s are rapidly
changing, and conditions tend to change more rapidly when the
economy is less regulated.
we begin to discern a reflexive relationship between the regu-
lators and the economy they regulate. it gives rise po a process
that takes place concurrently with the process of credit expansion
and contraction and interacts with it. it is no wonder that the
result is so complex and perplexing!
the regulatory cycle does not have the asymmetric character of
the credit ~ycle. it seems to fit the wave pattern we developed for
the currency market better than the boom and bust pattern of the
credit cycle. just as freely floating currencies tend to fluctuate
between over- and undervaluation, so market economies tend to
fluctuate between over- and underregulation. the length of the
cycle seems to be correlated with the credit cycle and one can
sense intuitively why that should be so. credit expansion and
contraction have much to do which changes in the economy,

86 theory
which in turn have a bearing on the adequacy of regulations.
, conversely, the regulatory environment influences not only how
fast credit can expand but also how far. clearly, there is a two-
way connection between credit and regulation, but it is far from
clear to me at this stage of the investigation what pattern, if any,
the interaction follows. that is the main source of my confusion.
we have identified a credit cycle that follows a boom/bust pat-
tern: a regulatory cycle that is more wavelike, and an interplay
between the two whose pattern is unclear. there are, of course,
many secular developments involved as well, some of which re-
late to credit, some to regulation, and some to both. we have
mentioned that central banks tend to get stronger after each crisis;
that is a secular development that renders each cycle unique. in
the great depression both the banking system and the interna-
4 tional trading system collapsed, making the contraction of credit
and economic activity much more severe than it would have been
otherwise. we can be certain that every effort will be made to
avoid a similar collapse in this cycle. we did not dwell on the
information revolution or on the improvements in transportation
that have helped the development of an integrated world econ-
omy. the outcome of all these influences is a unique course of
events that is easier to explain than to predict.
looked at from this perspective, the entire postwar period is
part of a large expansionary boom that is now well advanced and
ripe for a bust. the bust has been avoided, however, by the inter-
vention of the authorities at crucial moments. the interplay be-
tween government actions and the market mechanism has given
rise to a unique constellation that i have called reagan's imperial
circle. we are now at the crucial moment where the imperial
circle is beginning to unwind and the au+thorities must invent
another solution to forestall a bust.
the same postwar period has also seen an almost complete
swing from government regulation to unrestrained competition.
we are now at a curious moment where the bias in favor of dereg-
ulation is still on the rise yet the need for government interven-
tion in specific areas is beginning to reassert itself. the banking
industry, for one, is already on the way to becoming more regu-
lated.
one could try and write a history of the postwar era in these
terms. the present credit cycle started after the end of world war
11; the origins of the regulatory cycle go back even farther to the

the credit and regulatory cycle 87
new deal, although the creation of the bretton woods system can
be taken as the starting point as far as the world economy is
concerned. the expansion that followed was intimately related to
the removal of restrictions on international trade and investment.
but international capital movements created problems for the
bretton woods system that were never anticipated and remain
unresolved.
i shall not attempt to present the complete story here. 1 shall
start at the point where i became actively involved and i shall
follow the path of my own involvement. this will give the inves-
tigation a more experimental character.
my experiences began after the breakdown of the system of
fixed exchange rates in relationships that had been fixed
1973.
became subject to reflexive influences and my interest veered
from specific companies and industries to macroeconomic pro-
cesses. my study of "growth banks" in 1972 constituted a transi-
tion point, although i did not know it at the time.
with the passage of time i found the instability of macroecon-
omic trends increasingly disturbing in both a subjective and an
objective sense and i decided to distance myself from active in-
vesting in after the crisis of i made a theoretical study
1981. 1982
of the international debt problem. i was under the mistaken
impression that the crisis of 1982 constituted the climax in the
process of credit expansion. i thought that the authorities were
not doing enough to prevent a bust; i failed to regize that they
were doing too much. they actually kept credit expanding, albeit
on a more unsound basis than ever. the united states replaced
less developed countries as the "borrower of last resort" and com-
mercial banks tried to grow their way out of the loans made ta
less developed countries by aggressively expanding in other di-
rections. this led to another series of crises in 1984 that consti-
tuted the real turning point for the banking and thrift industries.
we are now suffering from the aftereffects of that climax. the
united states government continues to borrow on an ever-
increasing scale, but here, too, a turning point is at hand. the
dollar has begun to decline and foreigners are going to be repaid
in a depreciating currency. perhaps the last great engine of credit
creation that is still going full blast is in the stock market where
mergermania is at its peak; but it does not have a stimulating
effect on the real economy.
the theoretical framework of an interrelated credit and regula-

88 theory
tory cycle became somewhat clearer to me in the course of writing
i this book, although i cannot claim that the process of clarification
is complete. nevertheless, i felt it was appropriate to summarize
it at this point. i shall now use the theoretical framework outlined
here to explain the course of events since 1972. the reader should
be advised that the writing of the explanation predates the for-
mulation of this admittedly tentative theoretical framework.

p. s., december 1986
having completed the explanation, i engaged in a real-time exper-
iment from august 1985 to the end of 1986, trying to predict th.e
evolution of the credit and regulatory cycle. i came to a strange
conclusion. it appears that the cycle got stuck in 1982. if it had
4 not been for the successful intervention of the monetary authori-
ties, the international debt crisis would have led to a collapse of
the banking system. as it is, the collapse has been avoided, but
the genuine trend reversal which it would have ushered in also
failed to take place. we now live in a system where we contin-
ually go to the brink and then recoil when we see the abyss open-
ing up at our feet. the cohesion we manage to muster in the sight
of a disaster tends to disintegrate as soon as the danger recedes,
and the process then repeats itself in different forms. we can
observe it in international lending; in the u.s. budget deficit; in
the international monetary system; in opec; in the banking sys-
tem; in financial markets; and 1987 will undoubtedly be the year
when protectionism drives the international trade system to the
brink of collapse but probably not beyond it.

the international debt problem

the greatest problem in *eflexivity analysis is to decide what ele-
ments to single out for attention. in dealing with a financial mar-
ket the problem is relatjvely simple. the critical variable is the
market price and the elements that need to be considered are
those that influence market prices. but even here the number of
factors that may come into play is almost infinite. using just one
underlying trend and one predominant bias is an oversimplifica-
tion that may be useful in demonstrating the dynamics, not to say
dialectics, of a historical process, but it is totally inadequate to
explain, let alone predict, the actual course of events?
when we venture outside the confines of a particular market,
the problem of selection is even more complex. we need a set of .
interacting components that can explain the phenomenon we are
dealing with. but there may be different sets that could explain
the same phenomenon and we can have no assurance that we
have selected the right one. the plethora of potential components
is particularly troubling when we try to predict the future course
of events: we do not know which one will become significant.
the boom and bust in international lending is a case in point.
it is an indispensable element in the current economic situation.
taken by itself, it constitutes an almost perfect example of a
boomhust sequence. looked at in the context of the overall situ-
ation, it is just one of many elements that need to be taken into
account. to complicate matters, the international debt problem
has played a crucial role in the evolution of the banking system,
and the evolution of the banking system is also a reflexive process

92 historical perspective
that is significant in itself as well as being a significant element in
i the overall situation.
what is, then, the best way to deal with international lending?
one has to consider the subject from at least three points of view:
as a reflexive phenomenon in its own right; as a factor in the
evolution of the banking system; and as part of the current eco-
nomic situation. i shall try to consider all three at the same time
because that is the only way to avoid undue repetition. by choos-
ing this route, i shall also provide a practical demonstration of
the complexity of reflexive processes in the real world. it goes
without saying that the analysis is not an easy one to follow; but
i shall try to keep the three points sf view separate as we go dong.
some degree of distortion is inevitable: since we are interested in
the evolution of the banking system, we shall pay more attention
i to the lenders than the borrowers. if we wanted to explore the fate
of the less developed countries, we would have to shift our focus.
the origins of the international lending boom go back at least
as far as the first oil shock in 1973; but to discuss the evolution of
the banking system we have to go back even farther, and to under-
stand the economic cycle that has dominated recent history we
ought to start with the breakdown of the bretton woods system
in 1971. that would take us too far back; so i shall take early 1972
as my starting point, and i shall begin by looking at the banking
system in the united states. as it happens, that is the date of a
stock market report i wrote entitled "the case for growth banks."
banks at the time were considered the stodgiest of institutions.
managements had been traumatized by the failures of the 1930s
and safety was the paramount consideration, overshadowing
profit or growth. the st~dcture of the industry was pracirical'ly
frozen by regulation. expansion across state lines was prohibited
and in some states even branch banking was outlawed. a dull
business attracted dull people and there was little movement or
innovation in the industry. bank stocks were ignored by investors
looking for capital gains.
underneath the calm surface, changes were brewing. a new
breed of bankers was emerging who had been educated in busi-
ness schools and thought in terms of bottom-line profits. the
spiritual center of the new school of thinking was first national
city bank of new york, and people trained there were fanning
out and occupying top spots at other banks. new kinds of finan-
cial instruments were being introduced, and some banks were

the international debt problem 93
beginning to utilize their capital more aggressively and putting
together very creditabld earnings performances. there were some
acquisitions within state limits, leading to the emergence of larger
units. the larger banks typically leveraged their equity 14 to 16
times, with the bank oflamerica running as high as times. the
20
better banks showed a keturn on equity in excess of 13%. in any
other industry, such a ceturn on equity, combined with per-share
earnings growth of better than 10% would have been rewarded
by the shares selling at a decent premium over asset value, but
bank shares were selling at little or no premium. analysts of bank
shares were aware of this relative undervaluation but they de-
spaired of seeing the situation corrected because the underlying
changes were too gradual and the prevailing valuation too stable.
yet, many banks had reached the point where they were pushing
against the limits of what was considered prudent leverage by the
standards of the time. 'if they wanted to continue growing they
would need to raise additional equity capital.
it was against this background that first national city hosted a
dinner for security analysts-an unheard-of event in the banking
industry. i was not invited but it prompted me to publish a report
that recommended purchase of a bouquet of the more aggressively
managed banks. it documented the situation i have described here
and it argued that bank stocks were about to come alive because
managements had a good story to tell and they had started telling
it. "growth" and "banks" seemed like a contradicthn in terms, i
wrote, but the contradiction was about to be resolved by bank
' shares being awarded growth multiples.
banks stocks did, in fact, have a good move in 1972 and we
made asou4 50% on our bouquet. some of the more alert banks
managed to raise some capital. if the process of raising capital at
a premium over book value had become established, banks could
have expanded on a sound basis and the evolution of the banking
system would have taken a different course. as it happened, the
process had hardly started when inflation accelerated, interest
rates rose, and a 13% return on capital was no longer sufficient to
enable banks to sell shares at a premium.
then came the aftermath of the first oil shock and a tremendous
increase in the flow of funds to the oil-producing countries. these
countries did not know what to do with the money and it piled
up in the banks. a point was reached when some banks, like
bankers trust, felt obliged to turn away deposits. how to recycle

94 historical perspective
these so-called petrodollars became a major problem. there were
active discussions about intergovernmental schemes but nothing
much came out of them except for some increased saudi contri-
butions to the imf and th;! world bank. the governments of the
industrialized world failed dismally to rise to the occasion and it
was by default that the recycling of petrodollars was left to the
banks.
the banks stepped into the breech and fulfilled their function
all too well. flush with funds, they became aggressive lenders,
and they found plenty of takers. less developed countries with-
out oil sought to finance their deficits by running up large debts;
thoss with oil embarked on an~bitious expansion programs,
which they financed by borrowing on the strength of their oil
i reserves. this was the time of detente, which meant that eastern
european countries borrowed huge amounts from western banks
in the hope of repaying them using the products of the factories
they built with borrowed money. that is how the international
lending boom began.
at first, the banks were recycling the opec surplus. as time
passed, the oil-rich countries found other ways of utilizing their
new-found wealth: acquiring the most sophisticated armaments,
expanding their economy at a breakneck pace, buying diamonds
and real estate, and making other long-term investments. mean-
while, demand for bank financing continued to build. increas-
ingly, the banks became the source of credit. each loan created
deposits elsewhere so that the banks were able to generate the
funds they were lending by their own activity. since the eurodol-
lar market was not regulated, banks did not have to maintain
minimum reserve raquirements against the liabilities of their off-
shore affiliates. there was nothing to stop those affiliates from
creating a seemingly unlimited supply of credit except self-re-
straint.
but international lending was too profitable to leave much
room for caution. business could be transacted on a large scale,
the risk of adverse interest rate movements could be minimized
by the use of floating rates, and administrative costs were much
lower than in the case of corporate loans. fierce competition kept
spreads between borrowing and lending rates quite narrow;
nevertheless, international lending became one of the easiest and
most profitable forms of banking activity, attracting many banks
with no previous experience in the field. the number of banks

the international debt problem 95
represented in london grew greatly during this period, and inter-
national lending became the fastest growing sector of the banking
industry. naturally, if banks had set up reserves that would have
been appropriate in the light of subsequent experience, the
business would not hafre been as profitable as it seemed at the
time. i
i

the external shape ,of the u.s. banking industry remained
largely stagnant duringlthis period. expansion by way of mergers
and acquisitions was strictly circumscribed by regulation. but the
internal structure of banks underwent considerable transforma-
tion. the main corporate trend was the formation of bank holding
companies. the change of format allowed additional leveraging
at the holding company level so that the ratio of capital to total
assets continued to deteriorate. moreover, the so-called edge act
subsidiaries escaped some of the regulatory restrictions imposed
on banks. the greatest scope was abroad. accordingly, most of
the corporate moves were international with american banks ex-
panding abroad and foreign banks establishing footholds in the
united states. for instance, more than a quarter of citicorp's earn-
i7 s came from brazil.
t was also a time ofl rapid technological innovations. the use
of computers speeded up activities and permitted operations that
would have been previously inconceivable. many new financial
instruments and financing techniques were invented and banking
became a much more sophisticated business than it had been only
a decade ago. these trends continue at an accelerae pace to the
present day.
the task of the regulators was complicated both by the pace of
ianovation and by the international character of the competition.
it is not unfair to say that the regulators were always lagging a
step behind the practitioners and the industry became adept at
finding a way around whatever regulations were imposed.
in the international arena the authorities did not want to hinder
their own industry from competing on equal terms. with no reg-
ulatory constraints and individual banks competing for market
share, the market as a whole grew by leaps and bounds. banks
were so anxious to obtain business that they asked very few ques-
tions. it is amazing how little information borrowing countries
had to supply in order to obtain loans. lending banks did not
even know how much money the countries in question were bor-
rowing elsewhere.

96 historical perspective
debtor countries preferred to deal with commercial banks
i rather than go to the international monetary fund when they
were in balance-of-payments difficulties. unwittingly, commer-
cial banks took over one of the functions that the bretton woods
institutions-the imf and the world bank-had been designed
to fulfill. they tranferred resources to less developed countries
on a much larger scale than the bretton woods institutions would
have been willing to countenance, and with much less interfer-
ence in the debtor countries' affairs. no wonder that less devel-
oped countries stayed away from the imf! mainly industrialized
countries like the united kingdom asked for support from the
imf; developing co~ntries could do better with co~rm~ercial
banks. there was a veritable explosion of international credit be-
tween 1973 and 1979. it was the foundation of the worldwide
i inflationary boom of the 1970s, which eventually culminated in
the second oil shock.
in retrospect it is obvious that the borrowers spent the money
unwisely. at best they built white elephants like the itaipu dam
in brazil; at worst they spent it on armaments or used it to main-
tain unrealistically high exchange rates as in the "southern cone"
countries of argentina and chile. at the time, the folly was not
recognized. indeed, brazil was regarded as an economic miracle
and chile was praised as a paragon of monetarist virtue.
international lending grew so rapidly that the banks involved
became overextended: their capital and reserves could not keep
pace with the growth of their balance sheets. but the quality of
their loan portfolios remained sound-at least outwardly. indeed,
one of the most striking features of the situation was that the
borrowing countries continued to meet the traditional yardsticks
used to determine their creditworthiness even as their overall
debt burden grew at an alarming rate.
banks use ratios-such as external debt as a percentage of ex-
ports, debt service as a percentage of exports, and current deficits
as a percentage of exports-to measure creditworthiness. the in-
ternational lending activity of the banks set in motion a self-rein-
forcing and self-validating process that increased the debt-
servicing ability of the debtors, as measured by these ratios, al-
most as fast as their debt.
the key to the process is to be found in the very low and,
eventually, negative real interest rates that prevailed during the
1970s. since the eurocurrency market was outside the control of

the international debt problem 97
the central banks, its growth did not directly influence monetary
policy in any country. as the banks graduated from recycling
opec surpluses to creating credit, the monetary policy of the
united states remained relaxed. the dollar started to depreciate,
and interest rates failed to keep up with the rise in prices. the
decline in real interesi rates lowered the cost of debt service and
rendered the borrowing countries more creditworthy. it also made
them more eager to bbrrow. the expansion of credit stimulated
the world economy and helped export performance all around.
the less developed countries enjoyed strong demand for the com-
modities they exported; thus their terms of trade also tended to
improve. the combination of declining real interest rates, ex-
panding world trade, improving commodity prices, and the de-
preciating dollar enabled and encouraged the debtor countries to
increase their indebtedness.
the self-validating process of credit expansion-inflation for
short-was unsound in more ways than one. prices and wages
rose at accelerating rates. balance-of-payments deficits and sur-
pluses were perpetuated. the balance sheets of the banks deteri-
orated. much of the investment activity financed by bank lending
- was misdirected. the creditworthiness of the debtors was illu-
sow yet, as long as the process validated itself, the world econ-
omy prospered. consumption remained high while saving was
discouraged by low or negative interest rates. investment was
stimulated by the availability of cheap loans, there was a
flight from monetary to real assets. the combination of high con-
sumption, high inventories, and strong investment activity cre-
ated boom conditions.
the boom kept the demand for energy growing. the opec
countries grew richer and less in need of current income, while
negative real interest rates made it more attractive to keep oil in
the ground than cash in the bank. this provided the setting in
which the disruption of iranian production in 1979 caused a sec-
ond crisis and a second jump in the price of oil.
this time the response was different. inflation had become a
dominant concern, especially in the united kingdom and the
united states. continental europe and japan had escaped the rav-
ages of inflation by following a more restrictive monetary policy
and allowing their currencies to appreciate. since the price of oil
is fixed in dollars, the cost of oil to europe and japan fell, and, in
the absence of inflation, their exports remained competitive de-

98 historical perspective
spite the appreciation of their currencies. the united kingdom
and the united states, by contrast, developed large budgetary and
trade deficits, and inflation became a serious problem. britain had
to turn to the imf for help. the united states, controlling as it
did the reserve currency of the world, could inflate with impu-
nity; nevertheless, the domestic and international consequences
of inflation led to a shift in political preferences. the specter of
accelerating inflation took precedence over the fear of recession.
in response to the second oil shock, monetary policy turned re-
strictive and remained so even after the economy started to de-
cline.
monetarism became the doctrine that guided eeonornic policy.
previously, central banks sought to influence economic activity
i by controlling interest rates; now the emphasis shifted to control-
ling the quantity of money. interest rates were allowed to find
their own level. unfortunately, the level they found was inordi-
nately high. the main reason was that fiscal policy remained
stimulative, and it required a highly restrictive monetary policy
to keep the growth in money supply in check.
fiscal policy was influenced by supply-side economics. it was
believed that lower tax rates would stimulate economic activity
to such an extent that the impact on the budget would be neutral-
ized. the deficit could then be reduced by cutting government
spending. but the decision to increase defense expenditures at
the same time as taxes were cut made a balanced budget unattain-
able. the interaction between a swelling budget deficit and strict
monetary targets sent interest rates sky high. high interest rates
swamped the stimulative effect of the tax cuts. the budget deficit
widened, and the economy plunged into a deep recession.
the impact on the rest of the world was awesome. the debtor
countries were hit by a threefold increase in oil prices, plunging
commodity prices, soaring interest rates, a strong dollar, and a
worldwide recession. they engaged in a final binge of borrowing
that increased their total debt outstanding another 30%, but the
ratios measuring their creditworthiness rapidly deteriorated. the
situations in poland and in the falklands helped to undermine
confidence. there was a twilight period during which banks con-
tinued to lend, but reluctantly. maturities were shortened, and
some countries developed liquidity problems. then the mexican
debt crisis erupted in 1982, and voluntary lending to the heavily
indebted countries came to a virtual standstill. the position of

the international debt problem 99
the debtors was much worse than most bankers had realized. for
instance, brazil was using the interbank market to finance its
balance-of-payments deficit, unbeknownst to the correspondent
banks. the international lending boom turned into a bust.
we shall pause at this: point to analyze the international lending
boom as a reflexive process in its own right. the above descrip-
tion contains all the necessary ingredients of a boorntbust se-
quence. what are they? 'first, there must be a reflexive connection
between the underlying trend and the participants' perception.
second, there must be a flaw in the participants' perception that
influences the underlying trend through a reflexive connection.
the trend reinfomes the bias until a point is reached where they
both become unsustainable. typically, the trend appears to be
sound when it is first established and the flaws become apparent
only when the trend is already well advanced. there is a twilight
period during which the participants grow increasingly leery and
reluctant, and the trend loses momentum. eventually, the reali-
zation that the trend is unsound and unsustainable comes crash-
ing in. the prophecy is self-fulfilling and the trend is reversed,
often with catastrophic consequences.
in the case of international lending, there are a number of re-
flexive connections between the banks and the debtor countries.
banks use debt ratios to measure a country's capacity to borrow.
these ratios were generally considered to be objective measure-
ments, whereas in fact they are reflexive. as we k v e seen, both
exports and gnp are influenced by the volume of international
lending in a number of ways. moreover, debt ratios measure only
a debtor country's capacity to pay, not its willingness. to measure
willingness a different calculation is needed vcrhich is essentially
political in character. the critical variable is not debt service but
net resource transfer, that is, the difference between debt service
and the inflow of new credit. as long as debtor countries can
borrow freely their willingness to pay is not in doubt: they can
always borrow the money they need to pay the interest. but as
soon as the flow of credit is interrupted, the willingness to pay
becomes the critical issue. bankers refused to face the issue dur-
ing the great lending boom. walter wriston of citicorp asserted
that "sovereign nations don't go bankrupt. "
as we have seen, debt ratios remained largely satisfactory until
the second oil shock, and banks were eager to lend. when debt
ratios finally began to deteriorate, the banks started to worry and

100 historical perspective
their willingness to lend was impaired, precipitating the crisis of
4 1982. the crisis brought the reflexive connection between net
resource transfers and willingness to pay into play, leading to a
permanent breakdown in voluntary lending. what happened af-
terward will be the subject of the next chapter. here we are con-
cerned with analyzing the system that prevailed until 1982.
why the commercial banks were willing and able to sustain
such explosive growth in their international loan portfolios is a
fascinating question that will be hotly debated for years to come.
part of the answer is that banks did not consider themselves re-
sponsible for the soundness of the system. banking is an intensely
competitive business, whichis, however, subject to regulation.
it is the job of the central banks to prevent excesses. commer-
4 cia1 banks operate under a protective umbrella; they seek to max-
imize their profits within the framework of existing regulations
and they cannot afford to pay too much attention to the systemic
effects of their activities. a commercial banker who refuses to go
after what seems like profitable business is liable to be pushed to
the side, and even if a bank decided to abstain there are many
others anxious to take its place. thus, even those who realized
that the international lending boom was unsound found them-
selves obliged to participate or lose their places.
there is an important lesson here: participants are not in a
position to prevent a boom from developing even if they recog-
nize that it is bound to lead to a bust. that is true of all boomhust
sequences. abstaining altogether is neither possible nor advis-
able. for instance, in my analysis of mortgage trusts i clearly
predicted a bad end, yet mv advice was to buy now because the
shares would have to rise substantially before they crashed. as it
happened, a certain class of investors responded with alacrity.
but even if they had not done so, the boomhust sequence would
have occurred, albeit more slowly.
the best that a participant can do is to cease to be a participant
at the right time. but that may not always be possible. for in-
stance, in a system of fluctuating exchange rates, holders of finan-
cial assets have an existential choice in deciding what currency
to hold: they cannot avoid holding some currency, except by buy-
ing options. in the case of international lending, citicorp deliber-
ately reduced its market share in the later stages of the boom; but
that did not stop the drama from unfolding and citicorp from
being caught up in it. toward the end most banks knew that the

the international debt problem 101
position of the debtor countries was rapidly deteriorating, yet
they could not disengaie themselves.
the lesson to be learned is that financial markets need to be
supervised. only some, kind of intervention, be it legislative, reg-
ulatory, or a gentle hipt from a central bank, can prevent boom/
bust sequences from getting out of hand.
the history of centrtfl banking is a history of crises followed by
institutional reform. it is truly surprising that the lessons of the
international debt crisis have still not been learned. the cham-
pions of unregulated competition are more vocal, and more influ-
ential, than ever. they base their case on the inefficiency of
regulators and i$ must be admitted that they have a point. the
participants could not have prevented the international lending
boom from getting out of hand, but the monetary authorities could
have. why did they fail to do so?
there is no clear answer to this question. central banks were
aware of the explosive growth of the eurodollar market, although
they lacked reliable st,atistics. they recognized their responsibil-
ities as lenders of last resort and mapped out their respective
spheres of responsibility as early as 1975, but they did not deem
it necessary to regulate the growth of eurodollar lending. why?
the question requires more thorough historical research than it
has received so-far. i shall hazard two tentative hypotheses.
one is $at the central banks themselves were influenced by the
competitive pressures that affected the commercid banks under
their aegis. had they imposed regulatory restrictions, the banks
under their supervision would have lost business to others. only
concerted action by all the central banks could have brought the
burgeoning eurodoiliw market under control. that would have
required institutional reform, and the monetary authorities did
not recognize the need for reform. reform usually occurs after a
crisis, not before.
that is where the second hypothesis comes into play. i contend
that the central banks were acting under the influence of a false
ideology. it was a time when monetarism was gaining ground
among central bankers. monetarism holds that inflation is a func-
tion of money and not of credit. if monetarism is valid, the growth
of money supply needs to be regulated, not the growth of credit.
accordingly, there was no need to interfere with the eurodollar
market: as long as the central banks regulate their own money
supply, the market will regulate itself.

102 historical perspective
' the issue is arcane and i cannot claim to understand it fully.
money shows up on one side of the balance sheet of banks and
credit on the other. milton friedman tells us that it is the money
side that counts because the other side is determined by the
money side.2 the theory of reflexivity leads me to believe that his
theory is wrong. i would expect that the two sides influence each
other in a reflexive fashion, and his dream of controlling the
money supply is impractical. i lack sufficient expertise to take
him on directly, but i can point to the empirical evidence that
shows that the money supply always fails to behave in accor-
dance with the regulators' wishes.
\what role the growth of the eurodollar market has played in
the worldwide inflation of the 1970s has never been decided. for
t that matter, we do not know the extent to which the contraction
of international lending is responsible for the deflationary pres-
sures that seem to dominate the world economy at present. i
firmly believe that both the expansion and the contraction of in-
ternational lending have been important influences on the world
economy, but my view is far from being generally accepted, and
the issue remains unresolved to this day. if my view is correct,
the volume of international credit ought to be an important con-
sideration in setting economic policies. monetary authorities
committed a serious error in allowing it to get out of hand during
the late 1970s. the crisis of 1982 is as much a failure of regulation
as a failure of the free market.
we shall return to this issue again later. the imperfection of
both regulated and free markets is one of the main themes of this
book. now we have to deal with the new system of international
lending that evolved in response to the crisis of 1982.

the cot.t.ective system of lending

4
there can be no doubt that without the active and imaginative
intervention of the authorities the international debt crisis would
have led to the collaise of the banking system, with disastrous
consequences for the world economy. the last time such a col-
lapse occurred was in' the 1930s. because of that experience, an
institutional framework was established with a mandate to pre-
vent a recurrence. therefore it is inconceivable that events would
have been allowed to unfold without intervention. it is the form
that the intervention took that created a situation without parallel
in history.' rr*
the institutional setup gives central banks the authority, and
obligation, to act as lenders of last resort. but the debt problem
was too big to be handled by providing liquidity to the banks. the
amounts involved far exceeded the banks' own capital; if &e
countries in question had been allowed to go into default, the
banking system would have become insolvent. accordingly,
the central banks exceeded their traditional role and banded to-
gether to bail out the debtor countries.
a precedent of sorts had been established in england in 1974,
when the bank of england decided to bail out the so-called fringe
banks that were outside its sphere of responsibility rather than to
allow the clearing banks, from whom the fringe banks had bor-
rowed heavily, to come under suspicion. but the crisis of 1982
was the first time that the strategy of bailing out the debtors was
applied on an international scale.
the central banks did not have sufficient authority to execute

104 historical perspective
such a strategy, and makeshift arrangements had to be made in
i which the governments of all the creditor countries participated
and the imf played a key role. a rescue package was put together
for one country after another. typically, commercial banks ex-
tended their commitments, the international monetary institu-
tions injected new cash, and the debtor countries agreed to
austerity programs designed to improve their balance of pay-
ments. in most cases, the commercial banks also had to come up
with additional cash enabling the debtor countries to stay current
on their interest payments. the rescue packages constituted a
remarkable achievement in international cooperation. the partic-
ipants included*the international monetary fmd, the esnk for
international settlements. a number of governments and central
banks, and a much larger number of commercial banks. in the
case of mexico, for instance, there were more than 500 commer-
cial banks involved. i shall refer to the participants as "the collec-
tive."
the process was repeated several times over a short period of
gme. the story of what actually happened would make fascinat-
ing reading, but here we must confine ourselves to examining the
outcome.
the system of lending that emerged from the crisis is in many
ways the opposite of the system that broke down in 1982. the
prior system was competitive: banks were lending willingly, in
pursuit of profit and in sharp competition with each other. the
new system is cooperative: banks are lending under duress, in the
hope of protecting their already committed assets, and they act
jointly with other banks to this end. the prior system was reflex-
ive in a positive direction: the banks' willingness and ability io
lend were both reinforcing the debtor countries' ability and will-
ingness to pay, and vice versa. in the present situation, reflexivity
works in the opposite direction: it is the banks' inability and
unwillingness to lend and the debtor countries' inability and un-
willingness to pay that are mutually self-reinforcing. the system
could not survive without the various participants actively coop-
erating to prevent a collapse. action by the lenders takes the form
of extending new credit in order to enable debtor countries to
service their existing debt; action by the borrowers consists of
accepting austerity programs that keep the amount of new credit
needed to a minimum. what that minimum is depends on deli-
cate negotiations between lenders and borrowers. the imf has
taken the lead in conducting these negotiations, although debtor

the collective system of lending 105
countries are generally reluctant to allow the imf a permanent
role in monitoring thelagreements.
the system is highly precarious because it requires both lend-
ers and borrowers to ,override their narrow self-interest for the
sake of remaining paq of the system. in the case of debtors, the
sacrifice is measured 6y negative resource transfers; in the case of
the banks, by the amount of new credit extended. the sacrifice is
not symmetrical, however, because the borrowers pay interest on
the newly extended credit, while the lenders receive it. only if
the banks forgave some of the interest or principal would they
suffer an actual loss. but the collective system of lending is based
on the principle that the integrity 3f !hm debt must be preserved
-that is the principle that holds the collective together. unfor-
tunately, it leaves a crucial problem unresolved: debtor countries
need concessions to service their debt, but each concession adds
to their future obligations. recognizing the problem, banks are
building bad debt reqerves; but no way has been found to pass
these reserves on to tfie debtor countries without destroying the
principle that holds the collective together.
the collective system of lending came into existence un-
planned and unannobnced. it has been transitional from its in-
ception and it is bound to lead to something else. the most
interesting question that can be asked about it is what its eventual
outcome will be. unfortunately, this is not a question that can be
satisfactorily answered. for one thing, reflexive m e s s e s do not
have a predeteryined outcome: the outcome is determined in the
course of the process. for another, the prediction itself can influ-
ence the outcome. in this case, the hope that the collectives will
accomplish their mission is one of the main forces holding them
together; any statement that has a bearing on that hope immedi-
ately becomes a part of the situation to which it refers, so that it
is impossible to keep the discussion objective. nevertheless, the
question is pressing. can the approach i have taken help to pro-
vide an answer? and can an answer help to develop a theory of
reflexivity?
i published two papers1-one in july 1983 and one in march
1984-in which i tried to analyze the international debt problem
using a theory of reflexivity but not spelling it out. this is what i
said (with minor modifications):

for heavily indebted countries, the collapse of voluntary lending
has forced a drastic readjustment. the readjustment can be divided

106 historical perspective
into four phases. in the first phase, imports decline; in the second,
4 exports increase. during the first two phases, domestic economic
activity slows. in the third, domestic economic activity recovers
and both imports and exports rise. in the fourth phase, the advance
in gdp and exports exceeds the increase in debt service require-
ments and the adjustment is complete.
the first phase is involuntary. when the flow of credit is cut off,
the trade deficit is automatically eliminated by a cut in imports.
living standards are reduced, the production process may be dis-
rupted, and the country is plunged into depression. the amount of
lending required of the collective is determined by the inability of
the debtor country quickly to generate a trade surplus sufficient to
cover debt service requirements.
it is in the second phase that the real adjustment begins. the
currency is devalued in real terms, and productive resources, idled
by the reduction in domestic demand, are reoriented toward ex-
ports. the trade balance improves, and the ability to service the
debt improves with it.
it is at this point that the willingness to pay and the willingness
to lend become crucial. the country in question must increase its
imports in order to support a domestic recovery. that means a
reduction in the amount available for negative resource transfer. if
the hurdle is passed, the third phase begins. domestic recovery
renders negative resource transfer more palatable. as the economy
expands, the creditworthiness of the country begins to improve,
provided that exports grow faster than the gdp. when that hap-
pens, the adjustment process has been accomplished.
on the lending side, collectives operate with a chronic shortage
of resources. commercial banks can be divided into two categories:
those whose very survival is at stake and those who are only mar-
ginally involved. the first category co~stitutes the sore cif ;el col-
lectives. they can be counted upon po participate, but their
capacity to do so is limited. marginal members need more persua-
sion. as the sense of urgency diminishes, the marginals wish to
withdraw, leaving only majors to provide the flow of fresh credit.
the categories are flexible. the large u.s., u.k., and japanese
banks will always remain core members; u.s. regionals and many
continental banks are marginal to start with. in between the two
groups there are many banks whose existence is at stake today but
who may be able to build up sufficient reserves over a period of
time to qualify as marginal in the future.
because of the actual or potential shrinkage of membership, the
resources of the collectives are liable to remain fully stretched.
the collectives cannot meet the demands made upon them with-

the collective system of lending 107
out the injection of additional funds from international lending
institutions, but the institutions also are fully stretched. thus, the
collectives are bound to push for the maximum resource transfers,
making the hurdle between phase 2 and phase 3 difficult to pass.

i concluded that the'collective system of lending "is a system
born of emergency. it needs emergency conditions to survive, and
it is so constructed as 'to generate the emergency conditions that
are needed to keep it in existence."
by and large, this analytical framework stood the test of time,
although in retrospect+ i did make two serious mistakes. first, i
argued that dsbtcr csuzttries were willing to tolerate negative re-
to maintain access to capital
source transfers for two reasons: (1)
markets and (2) to avoid seizure of assets. i neglected to consider
what turned out to be the most important reason: (3) to maintain
access to export markets. with domestic markets in shambles, the
threat that export markets might be closed off was a potent one.
argentina was relatively the best situated to overcome an em-
bargo because most of 'its exports were fungible commodities, but
even argentina sells many items, such as shoes and steel, that are
destined for specific markets. moreover, the newly elected argen-
tine government did not want to be isolated from the western
world. it was determihed to avoid an "economic falklands." as a
result, the threat of default never became as serious as i expected.
in my analysis i did not put much store in the &st two induce-
ments. as regards free access to capital markets, i maintained that
the system of lending that prevailed prior to 1982 had broken
down for good~it had been based on certain misconceptions
which had been recognized es such. the pasitive bias had been
replaced by a negative one, and it would take a long time to
overcome it. events have borne out this analysis: bank lending to
less developed countries is far below projections. as regards the
seizure of assets, i dismissed it as a more or less empty threat.
since then this point of view has been fully doc~mented.~ having
ignored the third and most potent inducement, i concluded that
"the only way to ensure that the debtor countries will honor their
debt is to make credit available in quantities that approximate
their debt service obligations."
this conclusion was false. in 1984 less than half the interest
had to be advanced in the form of new credit, and much of the
new credit came from sources other than the commercial banks.

108 historical perspective
' as a result, the cash drain on commercial banks was less severe
than i had envisioned, and the strain between core members and
marginal members never reached the breaking point. in fact, even
core members have been able to begin building reserves against
bad debts and improving their capital ratios.
the second mistake i made was to underestimate the ability of
debtor countries to increase exports. the world economy turned
out to be much stronger than i expected, for reasons that will be
discussed in the next chapter. brazil, in particular, produced a
much larger trade surplus than i had expected. the official target
for 1984 was $9 billion; the actual figure exceeded $12 billion.
the strength in exporb led "i a modest domestic recovery and
enabled brazil to enter phase 3.
t these two mistakes together were sufficient to render my anal-
ysis unduly pessimistic. in february 1984 i asserted that "it is
increasingly unlikely that much progress can be made in phase 3,
and phase 4 appears increasingly unattainable under the present
system." yet by 1985 several of the major debtors had entered
phase 3, and the worst seemed to be over. then came the precip-
itous drop in oil prices in and mexico became a casualty.
1986,
the emergency could be attributed to external causes, but recent
developments in brazil are much more ominous. as a result of
the cruzado plan the economy became overheated in no time and
the international trade balance deteriorated dangerously. as soon
as the government was reelected in a landslide victory, it started
to rein in the economy. even so, it is clear that domestic political
considerations take precedence over international debt obliga-
tions, and 1987 is likely to be a year of crisis in brazilian debt
negotiations.
positions have softened considerably on the part of the creditor
countries. u.s. treasury secretary james baker recognized the
need for domestic growth in the debtor countries in the plan he
launched at the seoul meeting of the world bank in october 1985.
subsequently, the bradley plan expressly advocated forgiving a
portion of the interest and principal on the accumulated debt.
the fact is that the trade surpluses of the debtor countries have
become troublesome for the united states. the banks are better
reserved than they were a few years ago, so that 1987 may well
bring some measure of protection coupled with some measure of
loan forgiveness. if the experience of the last five years is any
guide, the changes will not be radical enough to cause a break-
down of the system.

the coliective system of lending 109
although it was faulty in its details, my analytical framework
remains valid in its broad outlines. it is not a blueprint for suc-
cessful adjustment but rather a model for surviving failure. as we
have seen, the collective system is held together only by the
threat of a breakdown.,as we shall see, this is a characteristic of
many arrangements wgich have prevailed since 1982.

reagm's imperial circle *

at the time of the international debt crisis i was working with a
rather crude and inarticulate model of credit expansion and credit
contraction similar to a boom/bust sequence in the stockmarket. i
thought that 1982 was the end of a period of worldwide credit
expansion and failed to anticipate the emergence of the united
states as the "borrower of the last resort."
the large and growing u.s. budget deficit emerged as the unin-
tended consequence of conflicting policy objectives. on the one
hand, president reagan sought to reduce the role of the federal
government in the economy by reducing taxes; on the other, he
wanted to assume a strong military posture in confronting what
he considered the communist menace. these two objectives
could not be pursued within the constraints of a balanced budget.
to make matters worse, fiscal and monetary policies were dom-
inated by two conflicting schools of thought. fiscal policy was
influenced by "supply-side" economics, whereas monetary pol-
icy was guided by the precepts of monetarism.
the supply-siders believed that a tax cut would have such a
stimulating effect both on output and on willingness to pay taxes
that the economy could grow at a rapid rate without exacerbating
inflation and the budget would be brought back into balance by
higher tax receipts. it was a thoroughly reflexive line of reasoning,
and it contained serious flaws, as such reasoning usually does. its

* this chapter, finished in august 1985, has not been updated. developments
since then are dealt with in the real-time experiment (part 111).

reagan's imperial circle 111
validity hinged on its be,ing universally accepted; therefore, it was
an all or none proposition. in a democracy that functions by com-
promise, such propositions rarely prevail. in this case, the
chances of success were particularly poor because there was an-
other major school of t+ught influencing government policy.
monetarists believed that the primary objective was to bring
inflation under control ~ n to d that end the money supply must be
strictly regulated. instead of controlling short-term interest rates,
as it had done hitherto, the federal reserve fixed targets for
money supply and allowed the rate on federal funds to fluctuate
freely. the federal reserve's new policy was introduced in oc-
tober 1979, and interest rates were already at record levels when
president reagan took office. in his first budget, he cut taxes and
increased military spending simultaneously. although a con-
certed effort was made to reduce domestic spending, the savings
were not large enough to offset the other two items. the path of
least resistance led to a ,large budget deficit.
since the budget deficit had to be financed within the limits of
strict money supply targets, interest rates rose to unprecedented
heights. instead of economic expansion, the conflict between fis-
cal and monetary policy brought on a severe recession. unexpect-
edly high interest rates combined with a recession to precipitate
the international debt 'crisis of 1982. henry kaufman had long
warned that government deficits would drive other borrowers out
of the market.' he proved to be right but it was theforeign gov-
ernments that were driven out first, not the domestic users of
credit.
the federal reserve responded to the mexican crisis of august
1982 by relaxing its grip on the money supply. the budget &licit
was just beginning to accelerate. with the brakes released, the
economy took df and the recovery was as vigorous as the reces-
sion had been severe. it was aided by a spending spree by both
the private and the corporate sectors and it was abetted by the
banking system. military spending was just gearing up; the pri-
vate sector enjoyed rising real incomes; the corporate sector ben-
efited from accelerated depreciation and other tax concessions.
banks were eager to lend because practically any new lending
had the effect of improving the quality of their loan portfolios.
the demand emanating from all these sources was so strong
that interest rates, after an initial decline, stabilized at historically
high levels and eventually began to rise again. banks bid for de-

112 historical perspective
* posits aggressively and holders of financial assets could obtain
even higher returns from the banks that from holding government
obligations. foreign capital was attracted, partly by the high re-
turn on financial assets and partly by the confidence inspired by
president reagan. the dollar strengthened and a strengthening
currency combined with a positive interest rate differential made
the move into the dollar irresistible. the strong dollar attracted
imports, which helped to satisfy excess demand and to keep
down the price level. a self-reinforcing process was set into mo-
tion in which a strong economy, a strong currency, a large budget
deficit, and a large trade deficit mutually reinforced each other to
produce noninflationary growth. 1 have called this circular rela-
tionship reagan's imperial circle because it finances a strong mil-
i itary posture by attracting both goods and capital from abroad.
this makes the circle benign at the center and vicious at the
periphery.
it can be seen that the imperial circle was built on an internal
contradiction between monetarism and supply-side economics.
the outcome was not intended or even anticipated. many mo-
- mentous historical developments occur without the participants
fully realizing what is happening. the tremendous transfer of
resources to less developed countries that occurred between 1974
and 1982 could not have taken place in a planned and organized
manner, and, as we have seen, the collective system of lending
came into existence unintended and unannounced.
most professional economists did not consider the emergence
or the survival of a benign circle possible, but president reagan,
despite his intellectual limitations, seems to have had a better
understanding of what was possible than did his economic advis-
ers. after all, the reflexive process of the imperial circle fitted
well with his concept of leadership-which is, of course, a reflex-
ive concept par excellence. he was therefore content to pay lip
service to the desirability of balancing the budget, ignored and
eventually got rid of martin feldstein, and left the deficit well
enough alone. europeans complained about the strong dollar-
although it is not quite clear why-but the u.s. administration
insisted on a policy of benign neglect.
a benign circle for the united states is a vicious circle for the
debtor nations. the trade deficit of the united states is mirrored
by trade surpluses in other countries. to the extent that a strong
export performance has enabled heavily indebted countries to

reagan's imperial circle 113
become current on their interest payments, the effect may be
judged beneficial; but, even here, the benefit accrues to the lend-
ers. for the rest, the debtor nations have been laboring under high
real interest rates and very unfavorable terms of trade. dollars are
cheap when they are boyowed, but expensive when the interest
has to be paid. the scramble to export depresses the prices of the
commodities exported. qlthough the external performance of the
debtor countries has exceeded most expectations, the internal
performance is much less satisfactory. there are some that have
shown practically no recovery, and even among the more success-
ful ones per capita income has been lagging; now that it has begun
to rise the trade surplus1 is beginning to deteriorate. somr: of tht?
weakest countries have endured a downward spiral in which both
their domestic economies and their abilities to service their debts
have deteriorated to the vanishing point. this group comprises a
large part of africa and some latin american and caribbean
countries like peru and the dominican republic.
as far as the more dgveloped countries are concerned, rising
exports to the united states have had a stimulating effect but the
response has been very subdued. corporations have been reluc-
tant to add to capacity because they are afraid, and justifiably so,
that the dollar will decline just when their capacity comes on
stream. by contrast, holding financial assets in dollars exerts an
almost irresistible attraction. the phenomenon is particularly no-
ticeable in britain, where currency swings have becpn especially
wild. the whole of europe has been languishing with high un-
employment and little growth, and it has become fashionable to
speak of "eurosclerosis." the far east has shown much greater
dynamism under the impetus of the newly industrialized cmrr-
tries and the opening up of china. japan has been the greatest
beneficiary of the present state of affairs. its position is almost the
mirror image of that of the united states, with a large export
surplus and strongdomestic savings counterbalanced by the ex-
port of capital.
let us try to analyze reagan's imperial circle with the help of
the analytical tools we have developed so far. we shall use the
notation adopted in chapter 3. the four key elements are a strong
economy ( t v), a strong currency ( t e), a growing budget deficit
( 3. b), and a growing trade deficit ( 3. 7'). at first sight, there are
some obvious contradictions between these four variables. con-
ventional economics tells us that a growing trade deficit ( 3. t)

114 historical perspective
tends to depress both the exchange rate ( j. e) and the level of
domestic activity ( j. v):

but the imperial circle managed to overcome these causal rela-
tionships with the help of two other variables: the budget deficit
and capital inflows.
the economy strengthened because the stimulus of the budget
deficit outweighed the drag of the trade deficit. economic activity
is, of course, influenced by many other factors. to bring them all
into the picture would complicate the argument unduly. what
matters is the end result: a strong economy. to keep the picture
simple, we shall denote the net effect of all other factors with a
question mark (?), giving us the formula

similarly, the dollar appreciated because capital inflows-
j. (n + s)-exceeded the trade deficit:

these two relationships are the mainstays of the imperial circle.
there are many other relationships at work, so many that it
would be onerous to list them all. some reinforce the imperial
circle; others work against it; yet others reinforce it in the short
run but cannot be sustained in the long run. the most important
self-reinforcing connection is between the exchange rate and
speculative capital inflows:

we have already identified two connections that work against the
imperial circle (equation i), and here we can mention two con-
nections that are self-reinforcing in the short run, but unsustain-
able in the long run. first, while speculative capital inflows are

reagan's imperial circle 115
self-reinforcing in the short run, they also generate interest and
repayment obligations that are cumulative and work in the oppo-
site direction.

eventually the growing debt service ( n) is bound to undermine
the relationship on which the imperial circle rests and the trend
of the exchange rate is going to be reversed:

at that time, debt service and the flight of speculative capital may
combine with the trade' deficit to generate a catastrophic collapse
of the dollar: central bank officials, volcker foremost among them,
are aware of the danger and are publicly warning against it.2 to
put matters in perspective, it should be pointed out that it would
take many years for interest charges to accumulate to a point
where they would reverse the balance. the likelihood is that the
imperial circle will be reversed or at least brought to a halt long
before that. volcker and other responsible government officials
are certainly working %o\vard &at end.
the crucial question confronting the world is whether the im-
perial circle can be arrested without precipitating a catastrophic
collapse of the dollar. the longer it lasts, and the higher the dollar
climbs, the greater the danger of a fall. the problem is that a clear-
cut reversal in the trend of the dollar could, even at this stage,
cause a shift not oqy in the ongoing flow of investment but also
in the accumulated stock of speculative capital. the stock is, of
course, many times larger than the ongoing flow. the problem is
widely recognized, making the holders of dollar assets very ner-
vous. that is why foreign holdings of marketable assets are aptly
described as "hot money."
the second example is the budget deficit, which is stimulative
+.

116 historical perspective
in the short run but may be counterproductive in the long run
i because it diverts resources from more productive uses through
the interest rate mechanism:

4 as long as high interest rates suck in capital from abroad, the
problem remains latent. with the help of foreign savings, the do-
mestic economy can consume more than it produces. only when
the capital inflow ceases to match the budget deficit does the
problem become acute. interest rates must rise in order to generate
the domestic savings necessary to finance the budget deficit. the
consequent decline in consumption depresses the economy, mak-
ing foreigners all the less willing to hold dollar assets. this may
give rise to a "disaster scenario" in which a weak economy and a
large budget deficit combine to produce high interest rates and a
weak dollar.
we can combine these relationships to create an integrated
model of the imperial circle:

reagan's imperial circle 117
in this model, one of the mainstays of the imperial circle, equa-
tion 2, is shown horizontally and the other, equation 3, vertically.
it will be seen that the model is not stable: some connections
reinforce it while others undermine it. the factors best reinforced
are the speculative inflows and the trade deficit; the factor most
endangered is the level 'of economic activity. the main threats to
the stability of the imperial circle come from the trade deficit and
the budget deficit. the thin pillars of the arrangement are a strong
dollar and a strong economy; but a strong dollar leads to a rising
trade deficit that weakens the economy and the budget deficit
keeps interest rates higher than they would be otherwise, which
also weakens the ecacorny, these are the internal inconsistencies
that are likely to destroy the imperial circle long before the accu-
mulation of debt service obligations would do so.
n dless to say, the model is incomplete. there are many con-
nectns that are not 'shown; the illustration is complicated
enough as it is. perhaps some connection that has been ignored
here will come to the rescue of the imperial circle when the need
arises. we have already witnessed such occasions. for instance,
until the middle of 1984, banks were active in expanding credit
at home and attracting funds from abroad. when they stopped
functioning as the main conduit, for reasons that will be ex-
plained in chapter 8, the treasury took their place: the withhold-
ing tax was abolished, and a large portion of the government debt
was sold directly to foreigners. 4
it would be interesting to construct a more complete model and
endow the variables with numerical values. i believe it would be
possible to simulate the evolution of the u.s. economy since
1982, but i am not equipped to carry out wch an operation. i have
to confine myself to an impressionistic presentation.
we are dealing with a system that is not stable, but constantly
evolving. what will succeed the imperial circle? that is the ques-
tion that needs to be answered. before i attempt to do so, let me
complete the picture by taking a closer look at the banking system
and the corporate restructuring that is currently sweeping the
country.

evolution of the banking system

it is generally recognized that the international debt crisis of 1982
constituted a dramatic point for the debtor countries. the direc-
tion of resource transfers was reversed and the magnitude of the
swing was limited only by the debtor countries' capacities to pay.
in our model of the imperial circle the swing shows up as a
nonspeculative inflow ( n) because it is guided by considera-
tions other than total return. the amounts involved are signifi-
cant: net resource transfers to heavily indebted countries swing
from $50.1 billion in 1982 to a reverse flow of $13.8 billion in
1983,' most of it in dollar form. resource transfers from the heav-
ily indebted countries have provided one of the major underpin-
nings for the imperial circle.
it is less well recognized that the crisis of 1982 did not bring a
similar turning point for the banking system. the largest banks
were too deeply involved to allow them to reverse direction. had
they stopped lending altogether, the heavily indebted countries
would have had to default. had they tried to set up adequate
reserves, their capital position would have been impaired. it was
to preserve these banks that the collectives were established. we
have dealt with the role of the collectives in tiding over the debtor
countries; now we must examine what happened to the banking
system.
the collective system of lending operates on the principle of
voluntary cooperation. the regulatory authorities had to exert
themselves to make it possible for the heavily involved banks to
extend new loans and to induce less involved banks to cooperate.

evolution of the banking system 119
the only way they could achieve these objectives was by main-
taining the fiction tha't the outstanding loans were unimpaired
and no special reserves had to be set up against them. there was
some divergence of opinion among the various supervisory agen-
cies but the federal reserve, as lender of last resort, maintained
the upper hand. the banking system was considered too weak to
be given any strong medicine. accounting standards were modi-
fied and special effortd were made to enable banks to meet them.
the last-minute bridge loan to argentina on march 1, 1984,
stands out as the most dramatic intervention by the federal re-
serve.
eurcpean central banks took e different tesk. they encowaged
commercial banks to set up reserves and write down bad loans.
they could afford to do so. european banks were, on the whole,
less deeply involved, and their accounting system permitted the
accumulation of large hidden reserves. the united kingdom oc-
cupied a halfway position between the continent and the united
states. some british banks were amongst those with the highest
loan exposure to less developed countries, but they had a much
sounder deposit base%in their own branch system so that they
were never as susceptible to a crisis of confidence as their amer-
ican counterparts.
it may be argued that the federal reserve went too far in sup-
porting the money center banks. these banks were allowed to
treat as current income the rescheduling fees anbxceptionally
wide spreads they charged on paper but did not collect in cash.
as a result, they could report substantial earnings gains, and some
of them actually increased their dividends in 1983.
ironically, the formation of the collectives, and the permissilre
attitude of the regulatory authorities that accompanied it, delayed
and diverted the adjustment process in the u.s. banking industry.
debtor countries had to face harsh reality, but banks were left
with a large load of doubtful debt whose doubtful quality they
had to hide. the ~ n l y way they could collect the interest was by
making additional loans. thus the problem was not only unac-
knowledged but also growing, the banks responded by trying
to grow even fast&. the most desirable way to grow was to pro-
vide services without tying up assets. money center banks devel-
oped a host of new services and marketed them aggressively.
but they were not averse to expanding their balance sheets,
either. almost any loan was of better quality than their portfolio

120 historical perspective
of loans to the less developed countries. this was the heyday of
leveraged buyouts; banks were willing to grant very generous
terms. banks were also aggressive bidders for deposits abroad
and used the funds to build up their domestic asset base. thus
they became the primary vehicle for attracting capital to the
united states.
unfortunately, banks were unable to use their remarkably good
reported earnings to raise equity capital, because the stock market
saw through the charade and bank shares were valued at substan-
tial discounts from stated asset values. chemical bank managed
to seize a propitious moment and sell some shares; manufacturers
hansver alss placed shares in connection wi4& its acquisition ui
cit corp.-but these were exceptions. on the whole, banks had
i to rely on retained earnings, which could not keep pace with the
growth in assets.
nevertheless, there was a race to expand and diversify. manu-
facturers hanover acquired cit corp. at a hefty price and the
artifice of the "nonbank bank" was invented in order to circum-
vent existing restrictions on geographical diversification. the
money center banks were pressing for permission to expand
across state lines, but they ran into stiff opposition from regional
banks who wanted protection. the protracted battle has only re-
cently been resolved, giving the regional banks a breathing space
before the money center banks are allowed to buy up banks out-
side state limits.
the federal reserve did not wish to put any constraints on the
banking system that would have a negative effect on the economy.
the first priority was to prevent a collapse and to that end they
wanted to engineer a strong recovery. only when the recovery
was well under way did they rein in the money supply, allowing
interest rates to rise. they could have also tried to rein in the
banks, but that is not what happened. bad loans continued to
accumulate and capital ratios continued to deteriorate. confi-
dence in the banking system remained precarious.
eventually troubles surfaced in the domestic loan portfolios.
large segments of the economy, notably agriculture and the oil
industry, did not participate in the recovery. in contrast to the
international debt, it was impractical to keep the domestic bor-
rowers afloat by lending them the money to pay the interest be-
cause there were just too many of them. continental illinois bank
was particularly badly hit because it had followed loose lending

evolution of the banking system 121
practices. specifically, it had purchased a large amount of un-
sound energy loans from penn square bank, which had gone
bankrupt. having no branches, it was in the unfortunate position
of being heavily dependent on borrowed funds. thus it became
the focal point of concern.
there was also troubte brewing in the savings and loan indus-
try. the equity of many institutions had been wiped out by the
rise in interest rates pridr to to prevent wholesale collapse,

a large number of institutions had to be merged or otherwise sal-
vaged during the reagan administration was looking to the
1982.
market mechanism for a solution. in one of the most remarkable
episodes in financial history many of the mgnlatory constraints
were removed just at a time when the capital of the industry
was seriously impaired. the range of activities in which savings
and loan companies could engage and the range of assets they
could invest in were greatly extended. since the savings and
loans had gotten into trouble in a regulated environment it
was assumed that the, removal of constraints would help to
get them out of trouble. private enterprise did in fact devise
ingenious ways to salvage bankrupt savings and loan com-
panies. most of the new money invested was immediately re-
couped as a tax loss and sawy investors gained control of
institutions licensed to gather government-insured deposits
with very little cash investment. some of these institutions
fell into the hands of operators who could use su& deposits in
support of other activities from which they profited. they had
much to gain but little to lose from expanding aggressively.
this was a formula for disaster. it is surprising that it was not
recognized as such.
the company that exploited the opportunity presented by the
regulators most aggressively was financial corporation of amer-
ica under the dynamic leadership of its president, charles knapp.
having acquired first charter financial, an old established insti-
tution whose deposits were insured by the federal savings and
loan insurance corporation (fslic), it went on a borrowing
spree, using brokgrs as well as a high-powered in-house sales
force. it then invested heavily in rather risky real estate loans as
well as fixed-rate mbrtgages. if any of the loans went sour, another
developer was found who would take it over in exchange for a
much larger loan on his own development. as interest rates began
to rise, the company averaged up its fixed-rate mortgage portfolio

122 historical perspective
at an exponential rate. knapp figured that in this way he would
have a high-yielding portfolio when interest rates finally declined
and if he grew large enough he could not be allowed to go broke
even if interest rates did not decline: heads he would win, tails
he could not lose. the calculation was correct. the company grew
from billion in deposits in 1982 to $20.3 billion in as
$4.9 1984.
the financial position of the company deteriorated, knapp was
forced out (after receiving severance pay in seven figures) but the
company was resc~ed.~

tion of america came to a head more or less concurrently in the

and thrift industries, although this fact is still not properly appre-
i ciated. bank examiners remembered their statutory duty and
began to take a stand on bad loans. regulators tightened capital
requirements, and insisted on strengthening bad debt reserves.
banks responded by shrinking their balance sheets, selling off
assets, and packaging loans for resale rather than putting them on
the books. the period of unsound growth came to an end and the
adjustment process finally began.
at first blush, the adjustment has been remarkably smooth.
banks became adept at packaging loans for resale, developing a
variety of financial instruments ranging from floating rate notes to
mortgage pass-through certificates. whenever necessary, other in-
stitutions have taken over the banks' role. junk bonds have re-
placed bank loans in financing mergermania, and treasury bonds
have taken the place of eurodollar deposits in sucking in capital
from abroad. it is no coincidence that the withholding tax on
foreign-owned bonds was removed just as the turning point in
bank expansion was reached.
with every passing quarter, the financial position of the banks
ought to improve. individual banks may be hurt when they have
to recognize losses but the industry as a whole ought to become
sounder. the stock market responded positively to the changed
outlook: bank shares rose to levels where they were selling at
premiums over book value.
but the period of danger is not yet over. it is after a trend has
been reversed that the full effect of the preceding excesses is felt.
while banks were given leeway, they could cover up their bad
loans by extending additional credit. but when banks are required
to set up reserves against bad or doubtful loans it does not pay

evolution of the banking system 123
them to throw good money after bad. on the contrary, they have
every reason to liquidate bad loans, because by doing so they can
convert non-earning assets into earning assets and they may also
be able to recapture some of the reserves they have been obliged
to set up. the danger is that the liquidation of bad loans uncovers
other bad loans. for instance, there were many farmers who could
not service their debt but the value of their land was still high
enough to provide adequate collateral: these farmers were given
additional credit rather than forced into bankruptcy. but the liq-
uidation of bankrupt farmers is depressing land prices, so that
additional farmers are forced into bankruptcy. the same is hap-
pening in the oil industry, and at the time of this writing (septem-
ber ominous signs are emerging in real estate. shipping is
1985)
probably next in line.
the bankruptcy of community savings bank of maryland and
its subsidiary, equity programs, inc. (epic), in 1985 serves as a
paradigm of what happens when the trend is reversed. the insti-
tution in question had been acquired by real estate developers
who carried on their syndicating activities as a subsidiary of the
thrift institution. they specialized in financing model homes and
enjoyed a good reputation. the mortgages on these homes were
insured by private mortgage insurance companies and sold to
investors in the form of mortgage-backed securities. following a
run on state-insured savings banks in ohio, savings banks in
maryland were required to seek federal insurance. the federal
savings and loan insurance corporation, in its chdened mood,
insisted that the real estate syndicating subsidiary should be
sold before the parent was granted fslic cover. that caused the
whole situation to unravel. the subsidiary coiild not syndicate
any new loans, and without new syndicaiions it could not ser-
vice its outstanding mortgages. it turned out that the income
from the already syndicated homes had been insufficient to cover
the mortgages and the deficiency had been habitually made up
from new syndications. in theory, the model homes would even-
tually be sold and would start to produce income, but, in practice,
the subsidiary had become heavily indebted to the parent and
it appears that some of the model homes did not even exist. the
subsidiary had issued about $1.4 billion of mortgage-backed se-
curities and the ,mofgage insurance companies were on the hook.
the potential liability exceeded the assets of some of the insur-
ance companies in question, and if they cannot meet their obli-

my brief account of recent events is sufficient to show that
regulators are not exempt from bias. they are participants in a
reflexive process and operate on the basis of imperfect under-
standing, just like those whom they regulate. on balance the reg-
ulators understand the business they supervise less well than
those who engage in it. the more complex and innovative that
business is, the less likely that the supervisory authority can do a
competent job.
regulation always lags behind events. by the time regulators
have caught up with excesses, the corrective action they insist on.
tends to exacerbate the situation in the opposite direction. that is
what has happened in the period under study. by the time the
4 authorities discovered that international lending was unsound it
was too late to correct the situation because the correction would
have precipitated a collapse. when they finally insisted that
banks recognize their losses, their insistence reinforced the col-
lapse of collateral values in areas such as agriculture, the oil in-
dustry, and shipping.
commercial bankers have also committed many mistakes, but
at least they have an excuse: they operate within guidelines laid
down by the regulators. their job is to compete, not to worry
about the soundness of the system. their excuse is valid in the
sense that, as long as there is no fraud involved, the authorities
will, in fact, bail them out if they get into difficulties. this com-
pounds the responsibility that regulators have to shoulder.
the authorities have given a good account of themselves when-
ever the situation has deteriorated to the crisis point. to sane
extent, this is due to the merit of the individuals involved. events
might have taken a different course if it had not been volcker who
was in charge of the federal reserve. he displayed a positive
eagerness in confronting difficult situations and coming up with
innovative solutions that is rare in a bureaucrat. but there is also
an institutional reason. central banks are given a mandate to act
as lenders of last resort. they have incomparably more authority
in an emergency than in the ordinary course of events. they are

surance company, went out of business, but the mortgage-backed securities

geared to crisis management and quite incompetent when it
comes to problem solvihg. to achieve any lasting solutions, the
whole machinery of the administration and congress needs to be
involved. that means that needed reforms are rarely enacted in
time.
the banking crisis of '1984 has left us with an unresolved di-
lemma. there is a basic imbalance in deregulating deposit-taking
institutions and guaranteeing depositors against loss. the guar-
antee enables financial institutions to attract additional deposits
at will, and deregulation gives them wide latitude in putting those
deposits to use. the combination of the two is an invitation to
unrestrained credit expansi-on the problem has been inherent in
the system of federal deposit insurance since its inception but at
the time the fdic was founded banks were strictly regulated. the
imbalance between risk and reward became more pronounced as
the trend toward deregulation gained momentum, and it reached
a critical point in the crisis of 1984.
the federal reserve was forced to expand its role as lender of
last resort and guaranteb all depositors against loss whatever the
size of their deposits. this removed the last vestige of the disci-
pline that depositors are supposed to impose on banks. in the
absence of that discipline there is nothing left but the regulatory
authorities to stop financial institutions from engaging in un-
sound lending practices.
it may be argued that shareholders would act as asonstraining
influence because they remain at risk, but the constraint is not
very effective since a bank can cover up its losses by lending even
more. by the time the losses can no longer be hidden, much more
will have been lost than the equity capital. thus, hil~ring equity
and loan capital at risk is not sufficient to ensure sound lending
practices.
the regulatory authorities have, in fact, become much stricter
since 1984. yet the popular and political bias in favor of deregu-
lation is as strong as ever. the geographic and functional restric-
tions imposed in the great depression are in the process of being
dismantled. theoretically, there need be no conflict between de-
regulation and stricter supervision; but in practice there is. as we
have seen, regulators make mistakes; the more varied and change-
able the business, the less likely that it will be adequately super-
vised. there is a strong prima facie case for keeping the deposit-
taking business as simple as possible. on the other hand, simple,

126 historical perspective
regulated businesses tend to breed stodgy, conservative manage-
ments. it boils down to a choice between stability and innovation.
when one of these ingredients is missing its absence is sorely felt.
as a consequence, preferences tend to swing from one extreme to
another. at present we are still elated by the opportunities that
have been opened up by the removal of outdated regulations; but
the need for stability is increasingly pressing.
there is another simmering problem that is approaching boil-
ing point. it concerns the treatment of insolvent financial institu-
tions. traditionally, the authorities prefer to arrange the
acquisition of failing institutions by larger, sounder ones. such
forced mergers used to offer an easy way out when the industry
was tightly regulated, failures were few and far between, and the
acquiring institutions were financially strong. the failing bank
4 had a valuable franchise that could be auctioned off to the highest
bidder without endangering the structure of the industry. but as
the process of credit expansion and deregulation progressed, the
procedure of "merging out" insolvent units became both more
frequent and less satisfactory. the franchises became less valu-
able and the acquiring institutions less able to withstand a dilu-
tion of their financial strength. a concentrated industry is
seemingly stronger. for instance, the clearing banks of the united
kingdom have never had any difficulty in attracting deposits, al-
though midland bank, for one, was in worse shape than any of
the surviving banks in the united states. but increasing concen-
tration increases the danger of catastrophic losses. what would
happen to the united kingdom if the clearing banks were unable
to collect the interest on their loans to less developed countries?
closer to home, bank cf america was encouraged to acquire first
of seattle; but who is going to acquire bank of america if the need
arises? * we have already had the first instance, that of continen-
tal illinois bank, where no buyer could be found. we may yet
arrive at a point where several of our largest banks end up as
public property. it has happened in other countries.
in no instance was the idea of merging out sick units so ill
conceived as in the savings and loan industry. as we have seen,
* to my great surprise, as of december 1986, first interstate is avidly pursuing
bankamerica, chemical bank is buying texas commerce bank, and
republicbank is willing to take over one of the weakest banks in texas, inter-
first, in order to prevent out-of-state competitors from gaining a foothold in the
state.

evolution of the banking system 127
much of the industry became insolvent during the 1980-82 pe-
riod of record high interest rates. the authorities devised the bril-
liant scheme of selling off ailing units to adventurous
entrepreneurs who appreciated the privilege of being able to at-
tract federally issued aeposits. we have seen how entrepreneurs
like charles w. knapp of the financial corporation of america
exploited the privilege. now that the regulators have put a stop to
uncontrolled expansibn, many of the excesses are beginning to
surface. only the decline in interest rates has saved us from an
avalanche of insolvencies.

within the context of reagan's imperial circle there is another
important reflexive development under way: the corporate struc-
ture of the united states is being reshaped by means of mergers,
acquisitions, divestitures, and leveraged buyouts. the move has
the dramatic quality usually associated with reflexive processes
and it has reached proportions that endow it with historical sig-
nificance. its roots go back to well before the inception of the
imperial circle but it has .gained tremendous momentum since
1982. the process of corporate restructuring is clearly interrelated
with the imperial circle but so far the relationship is rather lop-
sided: prevailing economic and political conditions provide the
context in which the restructuring occurs but the evolution of the
imperial circle has not been significantly affected by corporate
restructuring. the process that can be loosely described as mer-
germania is therefore best regarded as a sideshow rather than an
essential ingredient of the imperial circle.
in its impact on the corporate structure of the united states,
mergermania has already exceeded the conglomerate boom. con-
glomerates started out as relatively small companies that became
large through acquisitions; mergermania has involved the largest
entities in corporate america. there are many similarities be-
tween the two developments but the differences are more pro-

nounced. if the conglomerate boom represents the simplest case
of an initially self-reinforcing and eventually self-defeating pro-
cess, mergermania is perhaps the most complex. the conglomer-
ates provided a paradigm of boom and bust; mergermania
exemplifies a reflexive process in which the self-reinforcing and
self-defeating interactiohs are not sequential but simultaneous.
i shall not attempt a descriptive history of mergermania. i shall
simply assume that the, reader is more or less familiar with the
discrete corporate events that have occurred in the last few years.
my own familiarity with mergermania is not much greater than
that of a well-informed, member of the public because i did not
participate in it in a professional capacity.
corporate events have been occurring continuously ever since
there have been organized stock markets. whenever the market
value of the shares is higher than the value of a company as a
privately owned entity1 the corporate event consists of a sale of
shares; whenever the market value is lower, a purchase of shares
is involved. the purchaser may be the company itself, the man-
agement, an outside group, or another company that may have a
special reason for putting a high value on the shares.
the conglomerate boom combined the buying and selling of
shares. conglomerates were selling their own shares at inflated
prices and buying the shares of other companies. they could put
a higher value on the shares of other companies than the market
because the acquisitions helped to support the ov~rvaluation of
their own shares. thus the conglomerate boom was essentially a
phenomenon of overvaluation with inflated securities serving as
the means of exchange.
by contrast, in the current process of corporate restructuring
the primary means of exchange is cash. the cash may be bor-
rowed in a number of ways, but the final result is the same: shares
are bought for cash. there are occasional mergers that are accom-
plished by an exchange of shares but they are not characteristic of
the trend. there are also many developments, notably the dispo-
sition of assets and operating divisions, that do not involve the
purchase or sale of shares at all; yet the event that characterizes
the current process and qualifies it as a reflexive one is the pur-
chase of shares for cash. thus mergermania is predicated on the
undervaluation of shares: the company as a whole must be worth
substantially more than the market capitalization of its shares.
the undervaluation started to develop after the second oil

130 historical perspective
shock when a concerted effort was made to bring inflation under
t control through stringent monetary policy. it was greatly rein-
forced after reagan became president and the imperial circle
evolved.
we can discern three factors in the relative undervaluation of
shares: economic, political, and tax related. the first two are def-
initely interconnected with reagan's imperial circle; the third is
due to the peculiarity of our tax system. i shall emphasize it be-
cause it provides that element of distortion that seems to be an
essential ingredient in reflexive processes.
as long as interest expense is tax deductible, it pays to acquire
companies with borrowed cash, became is a savicg on taxss.
there
that is one of the major motivations in leveraged buyouts. there
are many other, more arcane, tax benefits involved, but this is not
i the place to explore them.*
shares traditionally have been valued as a multiple of earnings.
when the rate of interest is high, the multiple tends to be low.
but earnings are only a part of pretax cash flow, often a minor
part. yet, it is cash flow that is the primary criterion in determin-
ing the value of a business as a candidate for acquisition. thus
the traditional method of valuing shares has helped to create op-
portunities for acquisition, especially in periods, such as the im-
perial circle, when earnings are depressed and interest rates
relatively high.
let us take a profitable but mature company with little scope
for expansion-a so-called cash cow. if it is acquired with bor-
rowed funds, the interest can be paid out of pretax earnings. to
the extent that the market discounts pretax earnings at a rate
higher khan the prevailing interest rate, t h e is a margin of e a i -
ings, in addition to the free-cash flow, that can be used to pay
down the loan. eventually, the acquirer is left with a debt-free
company. as that point approaches he could, in theory, sell the
shares to the public, realizing a capital gain. he could then turn
around and buy back the shares from the public and start the
process all over again. in practice, several of the early leveraged
buyouts have resurfaced as new issues. i do not know of any
* several of them, notably the so-called general utilities doctrine, which allows
the acquiring company to write up assets and depreciate them from a higher
base, have been eliminated in the tax reform act of 1986. the tax deductibility
of interest has not been changed, but the corporate tax rate has been lowered
from 48% to 34%, thereby reducing the tax benefit of using borrowed money.

the "oligopolarization" of america 131
instances where a refloated company has gone private again, but i
know of cases where previous leveraged buyouts have been relev-
eraged in private transactions.
it can be seen that the tax system has made cash cows particu-
larly susceptible to leveraged buyouts, while the imperial circle
has had the unintended consequence of turning companies into
cash cows. the mechhism by which the effect is achieved is high
real interest rates and an overvalued currency. high real interest
rates render financial assets more attractive, and physical invest-
ments less attractive; thus they provide an incentive not to put
cash to work in expanding the business but rather to use it as a
financial asset: buying in shares or acquiring other companies. an
overvalued currency tends to render industrial activity less prof-
itable: export markets shrink and domestic markets come under
price pressure from irqports.
the combination of high real interest rates and an overvalued
currency proved to be a potent brew. the producers of tradable
goods have been put under great strain; often their survival is at
stake. they have reacted by consolidating: shedding unprofitable
divisions, abandoning activities where their market position is
weak, and concentrating on those areas where their position is
worth defending. traditional attitudes have been shaken up;
often there has been a change in management. gone are the days
when corporations pursued growth for its own sake; free cash
flow and profits have assumed an importance vmpiich they had
previously enjoyed only in textbooks. managements have started
to look at their businesses more like an investment fund manager
looks at his portfolio. this has created a suitable atmosphere for
corporate restructuring.
every time an acquisition occurs, it tends to narrow the gap
between market prices and the value to the acquirer. this brings
us to the most curious feature of the process. one would expect
that the acquisitions of shares for cash would reduce the extent of
undervaluation to a point where acquisitions are no longer prof-
itable and the movement comes to a stop. why has the gap not
been closed? to answer this question, we must invoke a political
factor. the reagan administration believes in the magic of the
marketplace. this finds expression, first of all, in the deregulation
of regulated industries, but it also permeates the government's
attitude toward corporate activity in general.
there has been no formal reform of antitrust laws but there has

132 historical perspective
i been a radical shift in what is considered an antitrust violation.
market share is no longer viewed in a static but in a dynamic
context. competition need not be preserved within a given indus-
try because companies can compete with each other across indus-
try lines. bottles compete with cans, plastic competes with glass,
aluminum with steel. technological advances can open up ave-
nues of competition that did not exist previously. long-distance
telephone service is the best example: what had been considered
a natural monopoly has become a highly competitive market.
moreover, the u.s. market is no longer viewed in isolation: inter-
national competition protects the interests of the consumer, es-
pecially when the dollar is so strong, and the national interest
+ dictates the consolidation of *u.s. producers into fewer and
stronger units. whether these considerations will remain as valid
in the future as they seem at present is open to question; but,
while they prevail, large-scale combinations do not face the polit-
ical obstacles they would have encountered in previous adminis-
trations. i call the process the "oligopolarization~' of america.
under the carter administration any large-scale acquisition,
like the purchase of utah international by general electric, pro-
voked an antitrust investigation that slowed down the transaction
even if it did not abort it. it was generally believed that companies
above a certain size were both immune from attack and disquali-
fied from making significant corporate moves. they lived in a sort
of suspended animation with managements safely ensconced and ,
confined to operating their existing businesses. since this view
was rarely challenged, it was not corroborated by evidence but
prevailed in the form of a bias. the bias found expressinn in stack
valuations. smaller companies were perceived as having greater
exposure to corporate activity and in consequence tended to be
more highly priced. between 1974 and 1979 the shares of small
companies outperformed large ones by a considerable margin,
and investors specializing in small capitalization stocks enjoyed
a field day. corporate activity, such as leveraged buyouts, was in
fact concentrated in that sector.
after there was a gradual but perceptible shift. the size of
1980
deals increased and industries once considered immune became
susceptible to attack. for instance, a few years ago beleaguered
companies used to acquire radio or tv stations as a way of de-
fending themselves; now the industry is up for grabs. both abc
and rca (which owns nbc) were taken over in friendly deals
and cbs, under attack, gained a new controlling shareholder.

the "oligopolarization" of america 133
the trend was not qecognized at first, but as it spread from
industry to industry it captured the imagination of investors and
it is now fully reflected in share valuations. since 1980, relative
performance has shifted back in favor of large capitalization
stocks, and mergermaqia has undoubtedly played a part in the
move. as the process continues, a point will be reached when
expectations exceed re+lity and the stock prices of the candidates
will hamper the conclusion of deals. the spread between pre-deal
prices and the pdees actually paid has already narrowed but the
pace of transactions has not yet slackened. mergermania has gen-
erated a momentum of its own and undoubtedly there will be
'some deals concluded 'at unreasonable prices before the process
exhausts itself.
looking at mergermania analytically, we may classify the re-
flexive interaction as primarily self-defeating or self-correcting. if
there is a self-reinforcing connection, it is lateral rather than ver-
tical: it expands the number and size of companies affected rather
than raising stock valses to unsustainable heights. there is rela-
tively little vertical or price action. successful acquirers, such as
gaf corp., attain higher stock prices and, if they can successfully
recapitalize themselves, they can swallow another company. if
the process lasts long% enough, favorites will emerge with pre-
mium valuations that will make it easier for them to fulfill expec-
tations. mesa petroleum was in the process of emerging as such a
premium company until unocal stopped it in its..tlfacks. on the
other hand, esmark has gone full circle, first acquiring and then
being acquired.
the self-reinforcing connection comes at first from the elimi-
nation of a negative bias. what has been done with one company
can be done with another and, encouraged by success, people
attempt what had not been thought possible before. eventually
excesses are bound to develop. in order to get a better insight we
must take a closer look at the players. first, there are the merger
and acquisition departments that engineer the corporate transac-
tions; then there are the lawyers who dream up new attacks and
new defenses; the actual acquirers; the providers of credit; and
the arbitrage traders who hold the stocks before and during deals
and often become active participants; finally, there are the regu-
lators who are supposed to supervise the process. all the partici-
pants, with the exception of the regulators, stand to earn very
large profits from successful transactions.
excessive profits often lead to other excesses, especially when

134 historical perspective
credit is involved. there is not much point in listing them in a
i general way. each transaction is high drama and drama is con-
structed out of human foibles. a narrative of specific events
would recount many mistakes, exaggerations, abuses, as well as
some bold maneuvers and brilliant inventions. in this respect,
mergermania does not differ from other activities that generate
windfall profits. there is a general predilection to pursue such
activities until some failures exert a discouraging effect. when
credit is used on a large scale, failures can mdwball. we have
already had at least one occasion when a large arbitrage trader,
ivan boesky, was forced to liquidate his positions, forcing some
others to do iikewise. there has also been much concern about
the debt accumulated in leveraged buyouts. until recently most
i of the credit came from banks. as we have seen, they were trying
to grow their way out of their difficulties after the international
debt crisis, and leveraged buyouts provided a ready market. but
the regulatory authorities started to discourage bank lending for
leveraged buyouts even before the twin crises of the continental
illinois bank and the financial corporation of america. for a
time it looked like financing would dry up, and the pace of cor-
porate activity did slow down. that was in the second half of
1984 just after some large oil companies had been gobbled up; the
elections were approaching and it was felt that additional take-
overs might be politically embarrassing. mergermania resumed
with renewed vigor after the elections but the main source of
financing shifted from banks to junk bonds. the shift was proba- '
bly dictated by necessity-unocal sued security pacific bank for
providing credit to a corporate enemy-but it turned out t~ be a
technical improvement. junk bonds are more flexible and more
easily arranged; they also offer some wrinkles that can be ex-
ploited for tax purposes. drexel burnham, the dominant force in
junk bond financing, can provide almost unlimited funds at short
notice.
will it all come to a bad end? that is impossible to predict. as
we have seen, the main reflexive connection is a self-correcting
one. the boomhust model we have developed for conglomerates
is not applicable. it is quite likely that the process will burn itself
out after it has swept all the ground that is susceptible to it. but a
disaster cannot be ruled out. the net effect is to introduce a great
deal of debt into the restructured companies. a number of differ-
ent scenarios could lead to situations where the debt is difficult

the "oligopolarization" of america 135
to service. if the impe~ial circle is reversed and the dollar falls
just as the economy slips into recession, interest rates may also
rise at the same time and highly leveraged companies would con-
front the worst of all ,possible worlds. in the more immediate
future, a precipitous f?ll in oil prices could endanger the cash
flow of heavily indebted oil companies like phillips petroleum.
one major default mi@ unravel the magic circle of junk bond
holders.
up till now, mergermania has not had a detectable influence on
the fate of the imperial circle. it has probably reduced physical
investment activity in the united states by making managements
more oriented isward 'the short term, but investment remained
surprisingly strong until recently. mergermania has probably con-
tributed to credit demands and induced banks to borrow abroad
in order to lend at home; but when the role of the banks dimin-
ished, the influx of capital from abroad continued. if there is a
reflexive connection, it* is too subtle to be readily discerned: it has
to do with the generaliattraction the united states holds for for-
eign capital at the present time.
another, more ominous, connection is beginning to surface. a
great deal of credit is employed in the acquisition of companies;
the credit is then repaid by disposing of the assets that served as
collateral. both activities, the nonproductive use of credit and the
sale of collateral assets, aggravate the prevailing deflationary
trends. mergermania may thus hasten the unwinding of the im-
perial circle.
assuming that the process does not end in disaster, what is its
overall effect? we find a mixed bag. in contrast to the conglomer-
ate boom where most of the activity was confined to the stock-
market, many changes will have occurred in the real world. on
balance, the profitability of corporations will be enhanced, assets
redeployed, and stodgy managements shaken up. industiies will
have become more oligopolistic. as long as the imperial circle
prevails these changes are desirable and probably necessary for
the survival of many industries. if and when the competition from
imports abates, the changes may turn out to be just the opposite
of what is appropriate to the new conditions.* accepting merger-

136 historical perspective
mania as a process of adjustment, we encounter a problem that is
t inherent in a world of reflexive interactions: adjustment to what?
it is like shooting at a target when the act of shooting moves the
target.
even if corporate restructuring qualified as an adjustment pro-
cess, it would benefit from being slowed down. if the pace were
slower, fewer deals would be made because the rate of return
would become less favorable. that would be an improvement
because there is a tendency to make more deals than are justified
by long-term economic considerations. the tax laws are primarily
responsible, but the participants playing with other people's
msuey must ahso share part of the blame. england has a takeover
panel that reviews the rules of the game; we could benefit from a
i similar arrangement.
on the level of theory, this analysis shows that the boom/bust
model is not directly applicable to all reflexive processes. with
this lesson in mind, we shall now address the question: what will
be the eventual outcome of the imperial circle?

p.s., december 1986
as it happened, mergermania outlasted the imperial circle. junk
bonds suffered a few nasty moments when oil dropped below $10
and ltv corp. defaulted, but the market recovered. both the eq-
uity and the junk bond holders of leveraged buyouts have been
greatly helped by the decline in interest rates, although junk
bonds have lagged behind high-quality bonds. the tax reform
act of has had the perverse effect of accelerating the pace of
1986
transactions prior to its taking effect on january 1, 1987.
then came the boesky affair and the arbitrage community was
shaken to its core. the full extent of the scandal is not yet known
but can be easily imagined. the investigation has already immo-
bilized many of the major players, and it is going to change the
way the game is played. by and large, the speculative excesses
generated by mergermania will be removed; what will be left is
the continuing restructuring of american corporations. the net
inflow of cash into junk bonds will be reversed and the extent to
which buyouts can be leveraged will be greatly reduced. most
important, it will become more difficult to refinance deals when
they turn sour, and the junk aspect of junk bonds will become
more apparent.

the "oligopolarization" of america 137
in short, the boesky affair constitutes not the end of corporate
restructuring but rather a well-defined and highly dramatic turn-
ing point in the reflexive aspect of mergermania. as in other sim-
ilar instances, it will be some time after the turning point when
the casualties surface. the epics of mergermania are yet to come.

bank of maryland into bankruptcy.)

the starting point: august 1985

we shall take up the history of the imperial circle at around the
elections of until then, the imperial circle had operated
1984.
without a hitch with both the u.s. economy and the u.s. dollar
continuing to rise. the central bankers of the world were fully
aware that the situation was unsound and ultimately unsustaina-
ble, and there was an episode at the beginning of when they
1984
tried to talk down the dollar but the attempt failed and the dollar
rose higher than ever. the economy continued so strong that it
dollar-denominated financial assets were really r &
overcame even a modest rise in interest rates. forei ners holding
'ng it in. so
were those exporting to the united states. surprisingly, american
industry hung in there in the face of severe pressure from imports,
reluctant to transfer manufacturing abroad and trying to stay com-
petitive by investing in high technology. the critical point was
reached around the final quarter of the pace of the economy
1984.
was beginning to slacken and interest rates started to ease but the
dollar, after an initial dip, continued to rally. prevailing opinion
had linked the strength of the dollar to the strength of the econ-
omy and to the interest rate differential. when the dollar refused
to weaken, the last of the trend fighters gave up and the exchange
rate went through the roof. that was the straw that broke the
camel's back: american industry started in earnest to switch to
imports and to foreign-based manufacturing. the strong dollar
finally became an american problem.
the conduct of u.s. economic policy underwent a significant
change after the elections. treasury secretary donald regan and
141

142 the real-time experiment
presidential adviser james baker switched places. until then, the
i federal reserve and the treasury had been at loggerheads, but
now an understanding was reached between them. slowing down
the imperial circle became the clear-cut objective. it was to be
achieved by reducing the budget deficit and relaxing monetary
policy. america's main trading partners were encouraged to give
their policy the opposite twist, engaging in fiscal stimulation but
keeping up interest rates. it was hoped that under these influences
the dollar would finally decline. treasury secretary baker went
so far as to express willingness to discuss a reform of the exchange
rate system prior to the bonn economic summit in may 1985, but
he failed to follow through. he was also unsuccessfui in ga'ining
control of the budget-cutting process in congress; nevertheless,
t the administration is clearly determined to accept whatever form
congress chooses for cutting the budget.
the dollar did respond with a thump, falling by about 15%
against the german mark. then it stabilized for about three
months, and recently it started declining again. the adjustment
so far is unlikely to bring any significant relief to industry. the
economy is now divided into two segments: the tradable goods
sector is in recession with the capital goods sector particularly
weak, but the service and defense sectors are still strong. interest
rates have fallen significantly and that is stimulating the econ-
omy, but as long as the dollar remains anywhere near its present
level, much of the stimulation will find its way abroad through
increased imports. most important, the pressure on profits in the
tradable goods sector is unlikely to relent.
what is the outlook? we can draw up two scenarios. in the first
the dollar declines by, say, 20-25% bringing relief to the tradable
goods sector. inflation may pick up a little, although the rise in
import prices may be compensated for by a decline in oil prices,
but the economy recovers, putting a floor under the dollar. this
is the so-called soft landing scenario. its prospects are better than
at any time since the inception of the imperial circle because
the authorities have finally recognized the need to bring the self-
reinforcing process under control and are cooperating to that end.
it is conceivable that the ever more violent swings in exchange
rates will moderate as-unannounced and unrecognized as usual
-we pass from a system of free floating to a system of managed
floating.
the other possibility is that the dollar refuses to decline and,
when it finally breaks, it does so precipitously. at first, foreign

the starting point: august 1985 143
exporters absorb whatever small decline occurs and do not raise
their selling prices in the face of a weakening market. the tradable
goods sector continues under pressure, and the weakness threat-
ens to spread to the other sectors. the federal reserve, deter-
mined not to allow the economy to slip into recession because of
the dire consequences it would have on the banking system, con-
tinues to pump money into the economy but much of the stimu-
lation continues to leak out in the form of imports. eventually, a
critical point is reached when foreigners become reluctant to hold
dollars, long-term interest rates rise in the face of rising money
supply numbers, the ddllar declines precipitously, and inflation
prospects deteriorate even as the ecouomy enkm+nb a full
fledged recession.
this may be called the disaster scenario, because a recession
would expose an exceedingly fragile financial structure to a test
that it is unlikely to withstand without severe damage. the heav-
ily indebted countries have barely entered into phase 3 of their
adjustment process. a ;weakening in demand for their exports
could push them back into phase 2 and the setback may be more
than they can bear. at home, the adjustment process is even less
advanced. a recession kould reduce the earnings capacity of bor-
rowers; it would also undermine the resale value of the assets that
serve as collateral. as banks try to liquidate foreclosed property
they set into motion a self-reinforcing process: other borrowers
are pushed over the brink. the process is alreadysrnder way in
the oil patch and in farming; in a recession it would spread to
other sectors of the economy.
this is where we stand at present (august 1985). as a market
participant, i must make some decisions based on my evaluation
of the probable course of events. the theory of reflexivity, as it
has been developed so far, does not yield any clear-cut predic-
tions, but it can be helpful in formulating my views. i have used
it in that capacity before and i shall attempt to do so now.
i propose an experiment. i shall record the views that guide me
in my investment decisions at the present time and i shall revise
them on a real-time basis while the book is in preparation. i shall
terminate the experiment when the book goes to the printer and
the reader will be able to judge the results. this will provide a
practical test of the value, if any, of my approach. it will also
provide an insight into the decision-making process of one market
participant.
a few words of explanation are needed about the investment

144 the real-time experiment
, fund i manage.* quantum fund is a unique instrument: it uses
leverage; it operates in many markets; and, most important, i man-
age it as if it were my own money-which it is to a large extent.
many funds share one of these features, but i do not know of any
other that combines them all.
the best way to understand the role of leverage is to think of an
ordinary investment portfolio as something flat and loose, as its
name implies. leverage adds a third dimension: credit. what was
a loosely held together, flat portfolio becomes a tightly knit three-
dimensional structure in which the equity base has to support the
credit used.
leveraged funds usually employ their borrowed capital in the
same way as their equity base. that is not the case in quantum
i fund. we operate in many markets, and we generally invest our
equity in stocks and use our leverage to speculate in commodities.
commodities in this context include stock index futures as well
as bonds and currencies. stocks are generally much less liquid
than commodities. by investing less than our entire equity capital
in relatively illiquid stocks, we avoid the danger of a catastrophic
collapse in case of a margin call.
in managing the fund, i distinguish between macroeconomic
and microeconomic investment concepts. the former usually dic-
tate our exposure in the various commodity markets, including
the stock market, while the latter find expression in our stock
selection. thus the ownership of a specific stock has both a macro
and a micro aspect in the sense that it affects the total size of the
fund's stock market exposure, and, if it is a foreign stock, it also
affects the fund's currency exposure. by contrast, a stock index
or currency position has only a macro aspect. we can, of course,
always neutralize the macro aspect of a stock position through
stock indexes and currency futures.
as far as currencies are concerned, i believe that a system of
fluctuating exchange rates presents an existential choice: one can-
not avoid having one's equity invested in some currency, and not
making a decision about currency exposure is also a decision-
unless, of course, one were to buy a currency option, in which
case one would pay a measurable price for avoiding the choice.
the logical consequence of my attitude is that i feel obliged to
make a decision about currencies even if i do not have a well-

* written in january 1987.

the starting point: august 1985 ' 145
formulated macroeconomic investment concept. the results
can be disastrous. sometimes i envy my more ignorant fund-
managing colleagues who do not know that they face an
existential choice; for instance, they avoided the losses i in-
curred in the 1981-198e period when the dollar continued to
appreciate.
it can be seen that quantum fund combines some of
the features of a stock market fund with those of a commodity
fund. historically, quantum fund operated at first almost exclu-
sively in stocks; only as macroeconomic conditions became in-
creasingly unstable did bonds and currencies assume increased
importance. in the last few years macroeconomic speculation has
become paramount. the degree of leverage we employ is much
more modest than in pure commodity funds, and the exposure in
various markets serves t~ balance as well as to leverage the port-
folio.
the fund's maximum exposure in any direction is subject to
self-imposed limits. if one relied on the limits imposed by margin
regulations, one would be asking for trouble, because one would
be forced to liquidate positions at the most inconvenient mo-
ments. one needs a safety margin over and above the margin
requirements. the safety margin can be quantified by looking at
the uncommitted buying power, but it is not a reliable measure
because different types of investments carry widely divergent
margin requirements. for instance, most u.s. stoas require a
50% margin, foreign stocks only 30-35% and the margin on s&p
futures is only 6%. where to limit one's exposure is one of the
most difficult questions in operating a leveraged fund, and there
is no hard and fast answer. as a general rule, i try not to exceed
100% of the fund's equity capital in any one market, but i tend to
adjust my definition of what constitutes a market to suit my cur-
rent thinking. for instance, i may add non-market-related stocks
and market-related stocks together or keep them separate as the
mood takes me.
generally speaking, i am more concerned with preserving the
fund's capital than its recent profits, so that i tend to become
more liberal with self-imposed limits when my investment con-
cepts seem to be working. where to draw the line between capital
' and profit is no easy task when practically the entire capital con-
sists of accumulated profits. the historical record up to the begin-
ning of the experiment is summarized below. it will be seen that

the only year prior to 1985 when the fund more than doubled
was 1980, and that was followed by a debacle in 1981.
during phase 1 of the experiment, the fund's activities re-
volved mainly around macroeconomic issues; the microeconomic
concepts did not change much, and their contribution to the
fund's performance was relatively insignificant. accordingly, in
summarizing the fund's investment posture i focused only on the
macro aspect. the situation changed during the control period:
specific investment concepts made an increasing contribution to
the fund's performance. this was in accordance with my macro
conclusion that it was time to play the stock market. since the
microplays became important only during the control period, i
refrain from discussing them, with one exception: my play in
japanese real-estate-related stocks enters into the discussion in
phase 2. -
the macro posture of the fund is summarized in a table follow-
ing each diary entry, and the activities and performance of the
fund are shown graphically at the end of each phase of the exper-
iment. the graphic presentation for the control period has been

the starting point: august 1985 147
subdivided into two parts because it is roughly twice as long as
the experimental phases:thus, the graphs are broken down into
four roughly equal time periods.

note: here is the key fbr the parenthetical numbers (1)
through
(6) that appear in the diary-entry tables throughout the real-time
experiment: i

(1) includes net dollar value of futures contracts.
(2) net purchases ( + ) or sales ( -
) since previous report.
(3) reduced to a common denominator of 30-year government
bonds. for instance, $100 million in face value of 4-year trea-
sury notes is equivalent to $28.5 million in market value of
30-year government bonds.
(4) u.s. treasury bills and notes up to two years to maturity;
these also have been reduced to a common denominator of
30-year bond equividents (see note 3).
(5) these bonds have cbnsiderably less volatility than u.s. gov-
ernment bonds. for instance, as of june 30, 1986, $100 mil-
lion in face value of japanese government bonds had the same
volatility as roughly $66.2 million in 30-year u.s. government
bonds. we have not,adjusted for this difference.
(6) net currency exposure includes stocks, bonds, futures, cash,
and margins and equals the total equity of the f s d . a short
position in dollars indicates the amount by which exposure
in the major currencies (dm-related european currencies,
yen, and sterling) exceeds the capital of the fund. exposure
in other currencies (mast of which do not fluctuate as much
as the major currencies) are shown separately. they are not
deemed relevant in calculating the fund's dollar exposure.

also, the percentage changes in net asset values in these tables
refer to per-share figures. the figures for quantum fund's aggre-
gate equity are affected, albeit modestly, by subscriptions and
redemptions.

phase 1 august 1985-december 1985
:

1 beginning of the experiment: sunday, august 18,
1985 *
the stock market has recently adopted the thesis that the rapid
rise in money supply is presaging a stronger economy. cyclical
stocks started to improve, while interest-rate-sensitive and de-
fensive stocks suffered a setback. i had to decide what posture to
adopt. i was inclined to doubt the thesis, but i did not have
enough conviction to fight it. accordingly, i did nothing. my
stock portfolio consists primarily of companies that stand to ben-
efit from corporate restructuring and of property insurance shares
that follow a cycle of their own.
as regards currencies, i have been leaning toward a soft-landing
scenario. in fact, i could envision the possibility that a stronger
economy would tend to strengthen the dollar. with so many spec-
ulators short, this could lead to a sharp, if temporary, rebound.
thus, being short the dollar was not without risk. accordingly, i
had significantly reduced my currency positions. for reasons i
shall outline below, i rebuilt them in the last few days.
i have been inclined to be optimistic on the prospects of a soft
landing because the decline of the dollar was induced by the
authorities; a spontaneous fall would have been much more dan-
gerous. since the reelection of reagan, the authorities have been
moving in the right direction and there seems to be a greater
degree of cooperation among them. practically all the excesses of

the imperial circle are in the process of being corrected: banks are
returning to sounder practices, the budget deficit is being cut, and
interest rates are being reduced.
my optimism is tempered by the insight that the time when
past excesses are corrected is the period of greatest risk. the ex-
cesses were meeting a certain need; otherwise they would not
have developed in the first place. can the system function with-
out them? moreover, the process of correction can develop its
own momentum, setting off a self-reinforcing trend in the oppo-
site direction.
everything hinges on the outlook of the economy. if the econ-
omy strengthened in the second half of 1985, all would be well.

150 the real-time experiment
even if there were renewed weakness in 1986, the financial struc-
i ture would already be in a stronger position to withstand the
consequences. in any case, that eventuality is too far removed to
have any relevance to current investment decisions.
i consider myself ill-qualified to match wits with professionals
who have much more information at their disposal in predicting
the actual course of the economy. that is why i have chosen to
stay on the sidelines in cyclical stocks.
the single most important variable is consumer spending.
some experts claim that consumers are overextended; others
argue that if you make money available, the american consumer
can be counted on to spend it who am 1 to judge? the only
competitive edge i have is the theory of reflexivity. it leads me
to diverge from the consensus opinion on the negative side. i be-
t lieve we are in a period of credit contraction where collateral
values are eroding. it would be appropriate if consumers failed
to respond to stimulation. this is a typical keynesian situation
where the horse is taken to the water: will it drink? i need more
evidence before i can develop any conviction on the negative
side.
recently, i have perceived such signals. perhaps the most
convincing was the market action itself. the stock market was
acting suspiciously badly. it may be surprising that i should ac-
cept the stock market as a valid indicator after i had enunciated
the principle that markets are always biased. but i have also
claimed that the market has a way of making predictions come
true.
various economic reports also indicated continued weakness.
for instance, auto sales were do~vn. did not aitrikte any great
3
importance to these reports, because the current weakness is well
recognized. what happens when general motors starts its low
interest-rate promotion will be more significant. i was much more
impressed with the report that this year's crops are going to set
records. this meant that either the distress in the farming sector
would increase or much more money would have to be spent on
farm price support.
the currencies were pushing against the upper limits of their
trading range. the bundesbank was expected to lower the dis-
count rate, but the mark refused to give ground. on wednesday,
august 14, i decided to establish a half position in the german
mark; after the german discount rate was in fact lowered and the

phase 1 august 1985-december 1985 151
:
mark remained firm, i bought the rest of my position. on thurs-
day afternoon, the federal reserve announced a large increase in
mi; the increase in m3 was more moderate. bonds fell and i
recognized that my thesis on currencies was going to be tested. if
the conventional wisdoin prevailed, currencies ought to fall in
the expectation of a strhnger economy and higher interest rates.
but if the tide has tuned, holders of dollar assets ought to re-
spond to a rise in money supply by converting part of that supply
into foreign currencies. as it happened, the currencies did not
yield, and my thesis was reinforced.
then came further evi,dence. on friday, both housing starts and
new permits were wee, especially for multifamily dwellings.
this confirmed my suspicion that the housing industry is in trou-
ble. in that case, commercial real estate must be in even worse
shape. bonds rallied, but the stock market continued under pres-
sure.
i am now willing to bet that the slowdown in the economy is
going to deteriorate into a recession: the contraction in credit is
going to outweigh the increase in money supply. 1 suspect that
the divergence between mi and m3 is an indication that the horse
is not drinking. i am aeady to take on a maximum position in
currencies, both on a long-term and on a short-term basis and to
short bonds on the rally. if the currencies do not respond vigor-
ously, i may have to become more cautious and take a loss on the
short-term portion of my currency positions.
it may be asked why i should short bonds if i expes a recession.
the answer is that i expect a recession because long-term interest
rates will rise on account of a weakening dollar. this is the im-
perial circle moving into reverse gear. i realize that my sale may
be premature; consequently i will take only a small starting posi-
tion. i am also contemplating selling the stock market short but
only if it rallies in response to a declining dollar. both my cur-
rency and my bond positions ought to work before i take on the
additional exposure.
the majority of my currency positions are in german marks. i
also have a significant position in yen but i expect the yen to
move slower and later. i should explain why. japan has a very
high savings rate and domestic investment has tapered off. by
investing its savings abroad, japan is able to maintain a level of
production well in excess of domestic consumption. this is the
way japan can become a leading economic power in the world:

152 the real-time experiment
a high savings rate, a persistent export surplus, and an accumu-
1 lation of foreign assets go hand in hand to enhance japan's
power and influence in the world. japan is very happy with the
imperial circle and wants to prolong it as long as possible. the
policy is articulated by japanese officials as follows: "we want
the united states to prosper as the leading economic power in
the world, because it allows us to prosper as number two." in
actual fact, japan uses the united states as a cyclist uses a car
in front of him: to cut the wind resistance. japan wants to stay be-
hind the united states as long as possible, and it is willing to
finance the u.s. budget deficit to this end. long-term capital out-
flows from japan rose from billion in 3,983 to $49.7 billion
$17.7
in 1984 and the trend is still rising. this has been the single
t most important factor in keeping the yen down. now that the
trend of the dollar has been reversed, the yen may appreciate
against the dollar, but it is likely to fall against the european
currencies.
i have had considerable difficulty in arriving at this conclusion.
in the 1970s, japan followed a policy of keeping the value of the
yen high, creating a high hurdle that exporters had to pass in
order to export profitably. the policy was very successful in fa-
voring the industries in which japan had the greatest competitive
advantage and in discouraging the older, less profitable exports.
i would have expected that in an environment where the rest
of the world was increasingly unwilling to tolerate a japanese
export surplus, japan would once again use the price mecha-
nism to ration its exports rather than to expose itself to quanti-
tative restrictions. this would have meant a high exchange rate
policy.
i failed to recognize the fundamental dissimilarity between the
two sets of circumstances. in the 1970s domestic investment
was still very high and available savings needed to be rationed;
a high exchange rate served as an efficient method of allocat-
ing resources. now there is an excess of savings for which
outlets have to be found. exporting capital is the best answer.
the resistance to japanese exports remains a stumbling block,
but the japanese hope to overcome it by providing generous
credit terms. hence the willingness to finance the u.s. budget
deficit.
the american response is ambivalent. some elements within
the administration are pushing for a higher yen; others are push-

phase 1: august 1985-december 1985 153
ing for the sale of u.s. government securities to the japanese.
ironically, it was american pressure for the liberalization of cap-
ital markets that led to the current massive japanese purchases of
u.s. treasury bonds. the interest rate differential in favor of the
u.s. was very great, ruhning as high as 6% at times. once the
floodgates were released, japanese institutions piled in. since the
dollar has started to decline, the total return has become less
favorable, but it has not discouraged japanese investors. on the
contrary, they seem to feel that the currency risk is less now that
the dollar has declined. japanese investors are even more herdlike
than their american coynterparts. should their bias shift, there
could be a stampede in ,the opposite direction. but that is highly
unlikely: the authorities act as shepherds, and they will do what-
ever is necessary to prevent a stampede. if my analysis is correct,
they are likely to keep the appreciation of the yen moderate
enough to preserve the prevailing bias in favor of u.s. government
bonds.
i should also explain ply views on oil prices. a decline is more
or less inevitable. production capacity far exceeds demand and
the cartelis in the process of disintegration. almost every mem-
ber of opec with the $exception of saudi arabia and kuwait
cheats on prices. as a consequence, saudi production has fallen
to unsustainably low levels. saudi influence within opec has
declined in step with output. the only way saudi arabia could
reassert control is by engaging in an all-out price war that would
demonstrate the strength of its market position as gw-cost pro-
ducer. but its market strength is matched by its political weak-
ness. the result is a stalemate that leaves saudi arabia
immobilized. market participants are bracing themselves for the
impending storm, but in the meantime calm prevails. spot prices
are quite firm, because nobody wants to carry any inventory. the
longer the pressures build, the more violent the storm is likely
to be when it finally occurs. the supply curve is inverted.
most producers need to generate a certain amount of dol-
lars; as the price falls, they will try to increase the amount sold
until the price falls below the point at which high cost producers
can break even. many of them will be unable to service their
debt. the u.s. will be forced to introduce a protective tariff to
save the domestic producers, and the protection is likely to be
extended to mexico, provided it continues to toe the line on the
debt issue.

154 the real-time experiment
i have been carrying a short position in oil for quite a while and
it has cost me a lot of money. futures sell at a large discount from
cash: carrying the position forward can cost as much as 2% a
month. i am now inclined to close out the positions i hold in
nearby months and establish a short position for next spring. the
price would be lower, but the discount per month would also be
lower. if my analysis is correct, the later the break comes the
bigger it will be.
the views i have outlined here are sufficient to serve as a basis
for what i call macroeconomic investment decisions. but they do
not answer the question: what is going to happen to the imperial
circle? on that issue, my crystal ball is cloudy.
other things being equal, the recession, if any, ought to be a
mild one. monetary policy has been eased even before we entered
a recession; inventories are tightly controlled, and a declining
dollar should bring relief to the tradable goods sector, although
the benefit may be felt only with a delay of 6 to 18 months. but
other things are not equal. the financial structure is already under
strain and it may not be able to withstand a recession: defaults
could be self-reinforcing, both domestically and internationally.
the financial authorities are fully aware of the danger and are
determined to do everything in their power to prevent it. if it
comes to a choice between recession and inflation, the odds favor
inflation. this is not a forecast, but a reading of current monetary
policy.
inflation would not be all bad: it would make the burden of
debt more bearable both by reducing real interest rates and by
boosting commodity prices. the question is whether a policy of
inflation could succeed. it is likely to elicit an allergic reaction
from the financial markets, inducing a "flight from the dollar and a
rise in nominal interest rates. if foreigners become unwilling to
finance our budget deficit, there must be a reduction in our gnp
one way or another. but then, the japanese may be willing to
continue lending to us even if it provides them with a negative
total return.

after i had taken my full position and plunged precipitously in

was sufficient to scare me out of my small short position with a
loss, but 1 held on to my currency long positions on which i now
also show a loss. the only thing that has worked in my favor is
oil, where i used a strong market to extend my short positions to
next spring. on balance, my trading has been poor, and i am
losing heavily since the start of the experiment. fortunately, the
profits i made earlier this year leave me in a still comfortable
position.
the cause of the reverse is a spate of statistics that indicate an
economic pickup. money supply soared, the trade deficit de-

156 the real-time experiment
clined, employment figures improved, as did retail sales. auto
i sales in particular exploded during the first ten days in which the
auto companies offered concessionary credit terms. the evidence
implies that the horse is drinking, after all.
i am inclined to fight the evidence and if i look hard enough i
can find enough quirks to explain most of the figures. one fact
remains: the surge in auto sales is sufficient to justify the rather
aggressive production schedule auto companies have been work-
ing on. closer inspection shows that almost all the employment
gains were auto related. the crucial question is: what is happen-
ing to consumer spending as a whole? are auto sales symptomatic
of consumer behavior, or will they be offset by redtic-ugd exgeildi-
tures in other areas? we shall only know the answer when it is
i too late.
for the time being, i am clinging to the view that the economy
is quite weak. the decline in the dollar has not been large enough
to bring any relief to manufacturing. agriculture is in worse shape
than ever. homebuilding could give the economy another boost
-housing is primarily dependent on interest rates and employ-
ment-but i believe that the fallout from the contraction of credit
and erosion of collateral values as exemplified by the collapse of
epic, the equity planning subsidiary of the community savings
& loan association of maryland, is going to depress the construc-
tion industry. consumer debt is heavy, and strong auto sales now
will reduce sales in the future. when 1986 models go on sale next
month, the economy ought to slip back to the same position it
was in before the auto companies started to force-feed it with
promotional credit terms.
the federal reserve is reluctant to tighten czedit because of
the many weaknesses in the financial structure. if dollars are
being created faster than foreigners are willing to absorb them,
the exchange rate ought to resume its decline-unless the econ-
omy is strong enough to induce the federal reserve to tighten.
it always comes back to the same question: the strength of the
economy.
since i cannot resolve it, i shall be guided by the market. the
german mark seems to have established a pattern that consists of
a sharp rise, an equally sharp break, and a halfway retracing of
the decline followed by a period of consolidation. if the pattern
holds, we ought to be at the bottom end of the second break. that
would fit in well with my economic scenario. if the pattern is

broken, i shall have to cut my exposure in half until i can reassess
the economic scenario. this will inevitably result in a loss be-
cause, if my expectations are correct, i shall not be able to reestab-
lish my position without paying up, and, if i am wrong, i will

158 the real-time experiment
have an additional loss on the half position that i kept. that is the
penalty i must pay for having taken too large a position at the
wrong time.
if my currency positions looked safer, i would consider buying
some government bonds in the next refunding because real inter-
est rates are once again reaching unsustainable levels, especially
if saudi arabia is really going to step up oil production.
my views on the longer term outlook are once again beginning
to veer toward the pessimistic side. the financial structure has
sustained additional damage. i have already mentioned the epic
story; the farm credit system has gone public with its problems;
and the liquidity crisis in south africa is establishing a new prec-
edent that may encourage banks to act even faster the next time a
similar situation arises. although the u.s. economy is showing
signs of strength, the position of our financial institutions is
weaker than it seemed a few weeks ago.

saturday, september 28,1985
we live in exciting times. the emergency meeting of the group of
five finance ministers and heads of central banks at the plaza
hotel last sunday constitutes a historic event. it marks the official
transition from a system of free floating to a system of managed
floating. readers of my chapter on reflexivity in currency markets
will realize that i regard the change as overdue.
i managed to hang on to my currency positions by the skin of
my teeth and after the meeting of the group of five last sunday, i
made the killing of a lifetime. i plunged in, buying additional yen
on sunday night (monday morni~g in &ng kong) and hung on
to them through a rising market. the profits of the last week more
than made up for the accumulated losses on currency trading in
the last four years, and overall i am now well ahead.
what gave me the courage to hold on to my currency posi-
tions was the pronounced weakness of the stock market. the
strength of the dollar depends on the strength of the economy. a
decline in stock prices can have considerable influence on the
spending decisions of consumers and the investment decisions
of those in business. moreover, if there is going to be a reces-
sion, it will be brought on by the decline in collateral values,
and the stock market is one of the most important repositories
of collateral.

the deutsche mark barely held within the perceived pattern
and my nerves were sorely tested, but by the time the group of
five met, the mark had rallied in conformity with the perceived
pattern. i am glad to report that the market reaction to the meeting
broke the perceived pattern. patterns are there to be broken by
historic events and the meeting truly qualifies as one.
the meeting was organized at the initiative of the treasury. the

ports. if not enough is done, the improvement in the yen will be
difficult to maintain.
the problem of the european currencies is different. specula-
tive flows are larger and the influence of central banks weaker.
the mark moved much less than the yen, indicating that spec-
ulators and holders of liquid assets remain doubtful about the
significance of the new departure. if the mark continues

phase 1 : 161
august 1985-december 1985
to appreciate, the difficulty will be in arresting the trend. it
would not surprise me'if volcker spent most of his time sunday
discussing not how to bring down the dollar, but how to arrest
its fall.
since the meeting 1 have concentrated on the yen because that
is the currency that matters as far as protectionist sentiment is
concerned, but if the policy of intervention is successful, i intend
to stay with the mark'longer than with the yen. the yen will
appreciate to a reasonable level, say 200 to the dollar, but the
mark may become overvalued. eventually, the real play may be
in gold, especially in case of a recession in the u.s.
t h action in ~tock~prices has been much worse &an, 1 ex-
pected. in fact, i bought the s&p futures after the group of five
meeting for a trade and i had to liquidate the position with a loss.
altogether, the market action is quite ominous. the erosion of
collateral values seems'to be much worse than i anticipated a few
months ago. i now believe that the economy will slip into a reces-
sion before the measures now undertaken will have had time to
bring relief. i also believe that additional measures will be forth-
coming. just as protectionist pressures brought a change in the
exchange rate regime, the pressure of high real interest rates may
well bring a far-reaching arms agreement and d6tente at the no-
vember summit. i am worried about the next six months, but i see
better prospects for positive policy initiatives than at any time
since the imperial circle came into existence. odalance, i do
not see much scope in taking a bearish posture in stocks, although
i see a lot of merit in liquidity and i wish i had more of it.
my short positions in oil have been going against me. the so-
viet union cut back on deliveries and kargh islmd has been effec-
tively put out of action. i decided to cover my short position for
march and april by going long for january. the discount is the
largest between now and january. keeping a short position open
has become very expensive. by buying for january, 1 have effec-
tively stopped the clock; i intend to reestablish my short position
later.

discount the rumors. in fact, i am using the current strength to
somewhat reduce my short positions in the dollar. i intend to
increase them further during the refunding period for u.s. gov-
ernment bonds.
since the group of five meeting, there has been a lot of contro-
versy between the treasury and the white house, on the one
hand, and the federal reserve on the other, some of which has

phase 1 august 1985-december 1985 163
:
seeped into the press. ,the politicians seem to advocate "dirty
intervention" in currency markets, while the federal reserve has
religiously sterilized all the dollars it sold by selling an equivalent
amount of treasury bills. the politicians argue that sterilized
intervention never works in the long run, but if the sale of dol-
lars is allowed to increase the money supply the exchange rate
is bound to fall. volqker's reply is that there is no need to
be so aggressive because the dollar is going to decline any-
how. if the markets are flooded with dollars, the dollar may go in-
to a free fall that may be difficult to arrest. volcker seems to
be more concerned with preventing a collapse than with in-
ducing a decline, and e sympathize with what 1 ticlieve ta be his
position.
if i were in his place i would keep interest rates stable until the
refunding is completed, selling foreigners all the dollars they
want for the purchase of government securities, and i would
lower interest rates after the auctions. this would ensure that the
auctions are successful; and it would provide me with a large war
chest to arrest the decline of the dollar when it has gone far
enough. the economyqis very weak and both interest rates and
the dollar need to be bought down. by waiting with an interest
rate reduction until after the auctions i could make a large-scale,
sterilized sale of dollars at a level that would look very good
later.
it is this line of argument that prompts me to bysome dollars
now. the market may be disappointed if there is no immediate
action on interest rates, allowing the federal reserve to sell dol-
lars at higher prices. that is when i want to increase my short
position even furtiler. i am also interested in buying bocds in iire
refunding unless they go up too much in the meantime. i have not
made any major moves in the stock market but i have whittled
down my long positions and enlarged my short positions to a
point where i seem to have a slight negative market exposure,
although my long positions far outweigh my shorts in actual dol-
lar amounts. i am increasing my short positions in texas and
california banks.

raising short-term interest rates. i took this as the beginning of a
new phase in the group of five plan in which exchange rates are
influenced not only by direct intervention but also by adjusting
interest rates. accordingly, i piled into the yen. when the yen
moved, i also bought back the marks i had sold. i lost money on
the trade but ended up with the increased position i wanted. at
today's prices i have a profit on the maneuver.

phase 1: august 1985-december 1985 165
there is something unsound about increasing one's exposure
in the course of a trend because it makes one vulnerable to a
temporary reversal. it will be recalled that a reversal came close
to making me disgorge my currencies at the wrong time earlier in
this experiment. the reason i am nevertheless willing to increase
my exposure is that i'believe that the scope for a reversal has
diminished. one of thy generalizations i established about freely
floating exchange rates is that short-term volatility is greatest at
turning points and diminishes as a trend becomes established.
that is the case now. the fact that we are no longer in a system of
freely floating exchange rates should diminish the risk of a rever-
sal even further. market particfpazta hava not y& recognized the
new rules; the amount of exposure they are willing to carry is
influenced by the volatility they have experienced in the past.
the same is true of me, or i would have reached my present level
of exposure much earlier, and i would have made even more
money on the move. by the time all the participants have ad-
justed, the rules of thei game will change again. if the authorities
handle the situation well, the rewards for speculating in curren-
cies will become commensurate with the risks. eventually, spec-
ulation will be discouraged by the lack of rewards, the authorities
will have attained their goal, and it will be time for me to stop
speculating.
i have also missed the beginning of a move in bonds. when
interest rates rose in japan and to a lesser exteap.in germany,
the market recognized that interest rates must fall in the united
states and bond prices rose in anticipation. my well-laid plan of
buying in the auction was preempted. i had to run after a mov-
ing vehicle and climb aboard the best i could. so far, i kave-estzb-
lished a half position at not very good prices. i intend to double
up in the next auction series in november. i must also consider
increasing my stock market exposure for reasons that i shall
explain.
this is a good time to reassess the entire outlook. the contro-
versy surrounding the gramm-rudman amendment has clearly
demonstrated that public opinion is in favor of cutting the budget
deficit. the gramm-rudman amendment was a brilliant device to
enable the president to cut programs that would be otherwise
untouchable. the cuts would start to take effect after the 1986
elections. the house of representatives has gone one better by
insisting that the cuts should start in the current fiscal year and

166 the real-time experiment
fall more heavily on defense. the senate version would have
4 favored the republicans in the election, but the house dem-
1986
ocrats turned the table by exempting many social programs and
bringing forward the effective date. the white house is in a quan-
dary: it must do something about the budget deficit in order to
pave the way to lower interest rates, but to raise taxes before the
1986 elections would be suicidal. there is a way out: to reach
some accommodation with the soviet union at the summit meet-
ing and reduce defense spending. the budget issue would be
resolved and the republicans could run in the 1986 election as
the party of peace. it remains to be seen whether reagan is inter-
ested in this soluiion.
if it came to pass, we would enter a phase of great prosperity
4 with lower interest rates, a lower dollar, and a stock market boom.
the enthusiasm generated by these moves would help to get the
economy going again and the baker plan announced at the recent
annual meeting of the world bank in seoul would help to keep
the heavily indebted countries from collapsing. mergermania
would receive one last push from lower interest rates but it would
eventually run out of steam because rising stock prices would
make new deals uneconomic. with the benefits of corporate re-
structuring, profits would soar in a more benign environment and,
with the shrinkage of equity capital that has occurred, stock
prices could go through the roof. eventually, the boom would be
followed by a bust in which the uneconomic deals come apart
and the international debt problem also comes back to haunt
us, but stock prices would have to rise before they can collapse.
that is why i am contemplating raising my stock market expo-
sure.
we are approaching the moment of truth. if reagan flubs his
opportunity, the consequences could be serious. we are hovering
on the edge of a recession and we need both lower interest rates
and a lower dollar to prevent an unraveling of credit. even then,
quite a lot of monetary stimulation may be needed to get the
economy going again. it takes time for the decline in the value of
the dollar to bring relief from import competition. in the first
instance, the expectation of higher prices may divert domestic
demand to imported goods. only a significant drop in short-term
interest rates, accompanied by better bond and stock prices, could
reverse sentiment in time to prevent a recession. without an
agreement on gramm-rudman, the bond market could be disap-

phase 1 : 167
august 1985-december 1985
pointed, the federal reserve would be reluctant to lower interest
rates aggressively, and the erosion in collateral values would con-
tinue.
the collapse of the international tin council provides a perfect
illustration of the erosjon of collateral values. the collapse of
opec is only a matte; of time now. i am increasing my short
positions in oil for jqnuary to march delivery. by the same
token i am buying oil-refining stocks, because the increased flow
should help their margins. as for the big picture, the next
couple of weeks will tell the tale. the summit meeting is on
november 19 and thelbudget debate has to be resolved before
the nextaauction can take place. that is w ~ j j
i have decided
to wait until the auction before taking a full position in
bonds.

saturday, november 9,1985
my views on currencies are being tested. after a sharp rise in
the yen, there was a sharp reversal last thursday. i was told
that the bundesbank had bought dollars below dm 2.60 but it
sold them again at dm 2.645 on friday. in accordance with my
contention that there is less risk in the market i refused to be
panicked.
the bond market is poised for a breakout on the upside. there
are large option positions in treasury bond futurss that expire
next friday. if the futures price moves above 80 before then, i
intend to sell all or part of my position, because i believe the
market is vulnerable. the white house cannot compromise on
the budget befose the summit on november 19 and the democrats
will continue to press their advantage. this means a stalemate for
the next week or so, followed by an auction as soon as it is re-
solved. i would be happy to withdraw from the market with a
profit, putting me in a strong position to buy at the time of the
auction.
the stock market has also been strong. divergences have per-
sisted but the market broadened out on friday. a breakout in
bonds could coincide with a temporary top in the stock market,
to be followed by a correction. i want to use that opportunity to
cover my shorts and prepare to take a long position. if the correc-
tion does not occur, i shall cover my shorts with a loss and if the
summit is successful go long at higher prices.

the markets continue to preempt me. both stocks and bonds rose

because i did not want to miss a strategic opportunity on account
of a tactical error.
i also took a significant position in japanese bond futures. this
is a new market in which i have no previous experience, but the
market participants i compete with must have even less experi-
ence. the japanese bond futures market collapsed (from 102 to

170 the real-time experiment
92) when the japanese government raised short-term interest
t rates. experience has taught me that the best buying opportunities
in long-term bonds present themselves when the yield curve is
inverted-which is the case in japan today. the rise in japanese
interest rates is bound to be temporary: the group of five wants
to stimulate worldwide economic activity, not to dampen it. a
reduction in u.s. interest rates would be matched by the other
major industrial countries and, if the impact on exchange rates
can be neutralized, the reduction may go further than currently
envisioned. i am making the same bet in japan as in the u.s. and
the odds seem even better.
i sm now fully invested in all directions: stocks, bonds, and
currencies. i would have obtained better prices if i had not tried
i to finesse it, or if the finesse had worked-but the main thing is
that i reached the posture i wanted. i am looking for an opportu-
nity to shift from bonds to stocks but i consider it prudent not to
increase my overall exposure any further.
events have unfolded more or less as i expected. the only
hitch was in the gramm-rudman amendment. congress passed
a one-month extension of the debt ceiling, enabling the auc-
tion to go forward while the fate of gramm-rudman remains un-
resolved.
the summit meeting lived up to my expectations. i believe a
radical shift in u.s.-soviet relations is in the making. both sides
need to reduce their military spending and both sides have much
to gain from closer cooperation. the opportunity was there and
president reagan seized it. by not making any concessions on
star wars, reagan has put himself in a position to usher in an-
other period of detente without exp~sing himself to criticism for
selling out to the russians. in this context, the gramm-rudman
amendment may come in positively useful as a mechanism for
cutting the military budget without appearing to want to. the
most eminently cuttable part of the military budget is retirement
benefits-stockman made an impassioned plea on the subject be-
fore quitting-and gramm-rudman may provide the perfect ex-
cuse. i expect a fairly stiff version of gramm-rudman to be
enacted-one that is closer to the house version than to the sen-
ate. in the present setting, that would no longer be as detrimental
to the republicans' election chances in 1986 as it seemed a few
weeks ago.
gramm-rudman would be followed by a discount rate cut in

phase 1 : 171
august 1985-december 1985
short order. that is what makes me take on the maximum expo-
sure in bonds at the piesent time. i realize there may be some
indigestion in the market after the auctions, but if my analysis is
correct there is still something left to go for.
after a discount rate c;ut i intend to cut my bond exposure and
increase my stock positions. stocks are more open-ended on the
upside than bonds. if and when the economy rebounds, stocks
will do better than bonds. if the economy continues to languish,
the reduction in short-term interest rates may go much further
than currently expected, but the dollar would also come under
pressure so that the yield curve is likely to steepen. it should be
remembered that d6tente is bearish fa: the dollas vis-l-vis euro-
pean currencies. if one wants to stay in bonds, the place to be is
the short end.
we may be on the verge of a great stock market boom. industrial
companies have suffered from a combination of inadequate prices
and inadequate demand. these adverse conditions have resulted
in the wholesale restructuring of corporate america. many com-
panies have been swallowed up by takeovers and leveraged buy-
outs. those which have survived have tightened their belts,
disposing of losing divibions and cutting corporate overhead. pro-
ductive capacity has been cut rather than increased, and market
share has been concenti-ated in fewer hands. the lower dollar is
now in the process of relaxing pricing pressures; if there is any
pickup in demand, it goes straight to the bottom l b . lower in-
terest rates and the lower inflation rate combine to make a given
level of earnings more valuable. after a period when industrial
shares were selling at a discount from their breakup value we may
enter a period when they once again sell at a premim. but before
we get there, we are likely to experience another wave of take-
overs, induced by the decline in interest rates.

end of phase 1: sunday, december 8,1985
this may be a good point to terminate the real-time experiment.
i have assumed maximum market exposure in all directions
and i have also announced my intention to shift gradually from
bonds to stocks within the constraints of prudence. at present
a large part of my stock market exposure is in the form of index
futures. with the passage of time i shall try to develop specific
stock investment concepts, and my performance will be increas-

ingly influenced by the validity of those concepts. to keep
a detailed account of my investment activities beyond this point
would take us too far afield from the subject of the experiment,
namely, predicting the future of the imperial circle. i shall
continue my periodic diary but it will serve the purpose of
control and not of formulating a prediction. in other words, i
wish to "freeze" my expectations about the future of the imperial

circle at the present time and submit it to the test of events.
needless to say, i shalt continue changing my portfolio as i see
fit.
i have about as firm a conviction about the shape of things to
come as i shall ever hgve, as witnessed by the level of market
exposure i am willing t'o assume. at the beginning of the experi-
ment 1 said that my crygtal ball about the longer term outlook was
rather cloudy. the experiment has brought about a remarkable
transformation: i now have a relatively clear vision of the future
and that vision differs significantly from the admittedly tentative
views i started with. i regarded the imperial circle as a temporary
expedient whose internal contmdictions were bou~d to render .it
unsustainable, and my presumption was that the problems that
the imperial circle had managed to keep at bay would resurface
with renewed vigor after its disintegration. specifically, the im-
perial circle constituteil an artificial extension of the period of
credit expansion with the u.s. government acting as "borrower of
last resort." when the imperial circle ceased to attract capital
from abroad in ever-inbreasing quantities, the last engine of eco-
nomic stimulation would be extinguished, and the contraction of
credit would create an'untenable situation. without a significant
expansion of money supply the burden of debt would become
unbearable; with a significant expansion, the dollar would go into
a free fall.
i am now beginning to discern the outlines of awther tempo-
rary solution that may succeed in unwinding the excesses of the
imperial circle without plunging us into a vicious circle. the
solution consists of switching from fiscal to monetary stimulation
in the united states and controlling the descent of the dollar
through international cooperation. the new constellation is al-
most the exact opposite of the imperial circle: a weaker dollar
and a subdued economy are accompanied by lower budget and
trade deficits and, most important, by lower interest rates. with
the help of a weaker dollar, prices are going to rise somewhat
faster than previously, rendering the change in real interest rates
all the more pronounced. declining real interest rates, together
with a possible pickup in exports, will replace the budget deficit
as the main driving force in the economy. rising prices will help
to counteract the erosion of collateral values and prevent a self-
reinforcing, deflationary process from taking hold. at the same
time, the coordination of economic policies will keep the decline
of the dollar within bounds, thereby eliminating the possibility of

174 the real-time experiment
' a self-reinforcing inflationary process. the outcome would be a
greater degree of stability than we have experienced since the
breakdown of bretton woods.
using the notation adopted earlier, we can depict the key rela-
tionship in the newly emerging state of affairs as follows:

the picture is much simpler than that of the imperial circle be-
exchange rates are stabilized. the extent to which interest
rates will decline depends on the amount of stimulation that will
i be necessary to keep the economy from sliding into a reces-
sion.
although the new constellation is almost the exact opposite of
the imperial circle, there is one essential difference between
them. the new constellation is the deliberate outcome of a con-
certed economic policy, whereas the imperial circle was the un-
intended consequence of conflicting economic policies. the
imperial circle was self-reinforcing until it became excessive and
ripe for a reversal; the reversal would also become self-reinforcing
unless it were deliberately controlled. the mechanism of control
is the management of exchange rates in the first instance and the
coordination of monetary and fiscal policies in the second.
it is the emergence of a concerted economic policy that has
caused me to change my expectations in the course of the experi-
ment. i was aware of the possibility of such a policy emerging and
i stressed the difference between the first and the second reagan
administrations. during the three months of the experiment, there
occurred several historic events that converted a mere possibility
into a historical reality: the group of five meeting, the baker
speech in seoul, the grarnm-rudman amendment and the summit
meeting in geneva.
what makes the emergence of the new economic direction so
fascinating is that the actual policy measures of which it will be
made up have not even been formulated. the group of five meet-
ing was merely a commitment to follow a coordinated exchange
rate policy, not an agreement on what that policy is; the baker
plan for international debt is certainly not a plan but merely the
announcement of a need for a plan; the summit meeting may mark
a new departure in relations between the superpowers, but it pro-

august 1985-december 1985
phase 1 : 175
duced no concrete results; and the fate of the gramm-rudman
amendment is still uncertain at the time of writing.
the actual policies are yet to be formulated. how far they will
reach will depend partly, on the farsightedness of the policymak-
ers but mainly on the pressure of necessity. necessity may be
defined in this context as the need to preserve the integrity of the
collapse in credit and to k eep protectionism at bay. the definition
financial and trading sy tems, or, in other words, to forestall a

is rather cavalier: it does not rule out individual defaults or par-
ticular instances of trade restraint; the crucial issue is that neither

success is far from assured. past experience is not encouraging.
a somewhat similar set of circumstances led to the collapse of
both credit and international trade in the 1930s. but exactly be-
cause the memory of the: 1930s is still so vivid, the prospect that
we shall avoid similar mistakes is rather favorable. there is gen-
eral agreement on some policy objectives: a controlled descent of
the dollar and a concerted reduction in interest rates. there is less
agreement on other points: how to reduce the u.s. budget deficit
and how to stimulate the economies of the debtor countries. it is
difficult to obtain concerted action even on the generally agreed
objectives. for instance; japan was obliged to raise interest rates
because the united states was unable to resolve the issue of the
budget deficit in time. how can one have any c d d e n c e that
appropriate action will be taken in those areas where even the
agreement on objectives is missing?
clearly, the situation is far from riskless, and, as we shall see,
the risks are the greatest in the short term. it is exa~tly '-3use be,
the risks are so great, and their severity is recognized, that one
can have a fair degree of confidence that the necessary measures
will be forthcoming. i am not the only one to think so: the finan-
cial markets have endorsed the new policy departure in no uncer-
tain fashion. the rise in bond and stock prices is helpful in two
ways: it encourages the authorities to pursue the course on which
they have embarked, and it enhances the chances of success. for
instance, the strength of the bond market enlarges the federal
reserve's freedom of action in lowering interest rates. we are
dealing with a reflexive process where the direction of economic
policy and the direction of the financial markets mutually rein-
force each other.
it is the response of the financial markets that has given me the

176 the real-time experiment
courage to take on such a large market exposure. it will be recalled
t that in the case of currencies when the change in trend was still
uncertain i was much more tentative and when the market moved
against me i was a hair's breadth away from cutting back my
position. in fact, the real-time experiment was instrumental in
helping me to hang in there because seeing my ideas clearly for-
mulated strengthened my convictions. my success in the market-
place has reinforced my confidence in my ability to predict the
course of events even further. 1985 is shaping up as a record-
breaking year for quantum fund: a more than 100% appreciation
within a year is heady stuff. i have to be careful. using the concept
of reflexivity to predict the -future course of events is itself a re-
flexive process, and a high degree of success is often the precursor
to a severe setback. it is clear from the experiment that my percep-
tions are partial and subject to correction by events. if i begin to
lay store on my longer term expectations-and what is worse, go
public with them-i may be setting myself up for a great fall. it is
a danger i intend to guard against. it will be interesting to see,
when we control the experiment, what will have remained of my
current game plan.
actually, it is less dangerous to cany a large market exposure
at the present juncture than to predict the eventual outcome of
the policies that are now being formulated. the mere fact that
there is an attempt to take charge of the world economy is suffi-
cient to give the financial markets a boost and, even if the hopes
are going to be disappointed, it will take time for the failure to
become evident; thus the attempt at a concerted policy should be
sufficient to sustain the present rally for a while. the eventual
outcome is quite another matter. there can be no assurance that
the market's expectations will be fulfilled. i must beware not to
allow my confidence in a bull market to affect my judgment about
the real world. i have become so involved in the market that i find
it difficult to maintain perspective.
i shall try to assess the future of the imperial circle in two
different ways: one is to identify the "thesis" that the current
market rally incorporates and evaluate its chances of success; the
other is to locate the present moment within the theoretical
framework of credit expansion and contraction that i have been
trying to formulate. both approaches employ the concept of re-
flexivity, but the first one sticks closely to the reflexivity inherent
in financial markets while the second seeks to explore the reflex-

phase 1 august 1985-december 1985 177
:
ive connection betweep credit and collateral values. needless to
say, i am on much surer grounds with the first approach.
i believe the market has come around to the view that the econ-
omy is fundamentally, weak and inflation nonexistent. a brief
rally in cyclical stockslin early summer has petered out and the
highs reached then have still not been surpassed. that rally has
been based on the mistaken expectation of an imminent pickup
in the economy, and it was very narrow: other segments of the
stock market were declining while the cyclicals rose. it was fol-
lowed by a general market decline that was cushioned by takeover
and stock buy-back activity. commodities also made new lows
and have been lagging sn the current recovery. metals, in particu-
lar, have acted very poorly in relation to currencies.
the recent stock market rally is much more broadly based than
the earlier flurry in cyclicals; it follows on the heels of a bond
market rally and it was preceded by a decline in the dollar. ob-
viously the markets are discounting a decline in the economy.
whether it will deteri~rate further is an open question. econo-
mists are almost unanimous in ruling out a recession, but the
stock and bond markets are acting as though it were an accom-
plished fact: stock prices are rising because investors are "looking
across the valley." it is possible that the slowdown of the past
year served as the equivalent of a recession; alternatively, there is
some further weakness to come. either way, the sequence of
events is highly unusual and investors have beedaken by sur-
prise: none of the technical indicators that normally signal a sig-
nificant upturn in the stock market has been present. the
november 27 lead article in the wall street journal entitled
"strange rally" has highlighted this fact.
every recession since the end of the second world war has
been preceded by the federal reserve tightening the money
supply, causing an inverted yield curve to appear at some point
along the line. an inverted yield curve preceded the rally in
the summer of 1982, but we have not seen an inverted yield
curve since. the explanation for the current sequence of
events has to be sought elsewhere. that is where the second
approach using my hypothesis about the credit cycle comes in
handy.
it will be recalled that i envision a reflexive relationship be-
tween the act of lending and the value of the collateral that serves
as security for the loans. net new lending acts as a stimulant that

178 the real-time experiment
enhances the borrowers' ability to service their debt. as the
amount of debt outstanding grows, an increasing portion of new
lending goes to service outstanding debt and credit has to grow
exponentially to maintain its stimulating effect. eventually the
growth of credit has to slow down with a negative effect on col-
lateral values. if the collateral has been fully utilized, the decline
in collateral values precipitates further liquidation of credit, giv-
ing rise to a typical boomlbust sequence.
using this model, i contend that the postwar period of credit
expansion has run its course and we are now in a period of credit
contraction as far as the real economy is concerned. all previous
postwar recessions occurred during the expiillsiontuy phase: that
is why they had to be induced by tight money. we are now in the
contractionary phase where a slowdown need not be induced: in
the absence of new stimulants, such as a growing budget deficit,
the erosion of collateral values will do the job.
the trouble is that real life is not as simple as the model i have
been working with. in particular, the transition from credit expan-
sion to credit contraction does not occur at a single point of time
because it would precipitate an implosion that the authorities are
determined to prevent. official intervention complicates matters.
the turning point does not occur at a single moment of time, but
different segments of the credit structure follow different time-
tables. to locate our position in the credit cycle, it is necessary to
disaggregate the process and consider the main elements of credit
separately.
this approach yields 1982 as the turning point for the heavily
indebted countries, 1984 as the turning point for u.s. financial
institutions, and 1986 as the turning poi& for the u.s. budget
deficit. the contraction of credit in less developed countries has
probably reached its peak in the adjustment process is
1984;
largely responsible for the oversupply of basic commodities. the
adjustment process by u.s. banks and savings and loan institu-
tions has only recently begun to make its effect felt on collateral
values in real estate, land, shipping, and the oil industry. the
reduction in the budget deficit has not yet taken effect and it is to
be expected that it will be fully compensated for by a reduction
in interest rates. two more important pieces need to be fitted into
the jigsaw puzzle: mergermania and consumer spending.
leveraged buyouts and other manifestations of mergermania
are great users of credit but they tend to produce a corresponding

august 1985-december 1985
phase 1 : 179
amount of liquid assets. superficially, they seem to be expansion-
ary but in fact they fit into the declining phase of the credit cycle:
they increase the total amount of debt without stimulating the
economy. cash flow is, used to service debt rather than to pur-
chase physical assets; t$e disposal of assets adds to the downward
pressure on collateral dalues; and the sale of junk bonds tends to
steepen the yield curve: the net effect on the economy is depress-
ing rather than stimulafing.
consumer spending is the great unknown. consumer indebt-
edness has been rising steadily over the years, and repayment
terms have been extended to a point where it is hard to see
how they can be extended cny further. until recently, houses
could be bought with a 5% down payment and auto loans could
be repaid over five years. delinquencies in consumer loans have
risen ominously in the course of 1985, but the simultaneous
decline in interest rates and the dollar should alleviate the
situation. will these ,developments merely serve to contain
the delinquency problem, or will they stimulate new demand?
that is the crucial question on which the near-term outlook
hinges.
if consumer spending remains sluggish, the bull market in
bonds and stocks may have considerable staying power; in fact,
we could have one of the great bull markets of all times. a pickup
in the domestic savings rate would offset the reduction in the
inflow of foreign capital allowing interest rates to dgcline in spite
of the decline in the dollar. the stock market would benefit from
both developments. lower interest rates would enhance the value
of a given level of earnings, and the lower dollar would enhance
the level of earnings by mitigating pricing pressures from imports.
in a sluggish economy the cost of labor would remain depressed.
threatened by adverse economic conditions and corporate take-
overs, managements have redeployed assets and reduced over-
head expenses; as conditions improve, the benefits flow directly
down to the bottom line. as interest rates decline, there would be
one last rush of corporate takeovers and leveraged buyouts, in the
1
course of wh'ch exaggerated prices may be paid; but recent events
make past a quisitions more viable and deals that may have been
unsound w en consummated are now looking healthier. even-
tually the hise in stock prices should render leveraged buyouts
uneconomic, and merger activity should peter out. that would be
a very p'ositive development for the real economy because it

180 the real-time experiment
would enhance the attraction of investing in physical assets stim-
4 ulating not only demand but also supply. should we reach that
point, our economy would be healthier than it has been for some
time. the boom may eventually get out of hand and set us up for
a great crash, but share prices would have to rise a great deal
before we reach that point. it is an argument for buying stocks
now.
on the other hand, if consumer spending does pick up under
the impetus of lower interest rates, the boom in financial markets
will be short-lived and the real economy is likely to follow the
stop-go pattern familiar from the british example. with inade-
quate domestic savings and doaesti~ iaveshnent, the excess of
both credit and consumption would have to be met from abroad
4 and we would be back in the situation that prevailed at the end
of the imperial circle. either we raise interest rates, restarting the
imperial circle and choking off the domestic economy, or we
print money, setting in motion a vicious circle in the opposite
direction.
reality is likely to fall between these extremes, but that is not
saying much because the extremes open up an almost infi-
nite range of possibilities. i am no better qualified to predict con-
sumer behavior than i was at the beginning of the experiment.
all i can do is evaluate the consequences of the various alterna-
tives.
it can be seen that a period of subdued consumer spending
could do much to correct the last two major areas of excess credit.
mergermania would run out of steam as the stock market rises
and the overindebtedness of consumers would be corrected as the
savings rate rises and lenders tighter1 their criteria. mer a while,
conditions would-be ripe for more balanced growth.
when past excesses are being corrected it is always a period of
maximum risk. that is the case now. there have already been a
number of minor catastrophes: the epic debacle has been fol-
lowed by others in the real estate lending arena; the federal sav-
ings and loan insurance corporation and the farm credit sys-
tem have gone public with their woes; the international tin
council has been unable to meet its obligations, tin trading on the
london metal exchange has been suspended, and many metal
traders are going out of business; the largest japanese shipping
company has gone broke; just now the singapore stock exchange
has had to close for a few days; and there are obviously other

phase 1: august 1985-december 1985 181
events yet to come. we are facing at least two shocks that exceed
in magnitude anything we have experienced to date. one relates
to oil, the other to international debt.
the collapse of oil prices is only a matter of time. once it begins
it will not stop of its owh volition. most countries operate with a
perverse supply curve: ihe lower the price of oil, the more they
need to sell in order to meet their needs. left to itself, the price of
oil could temporarily fall to a single digit, but it will not be left to
itself. domestic industry will have to be protected below $22,
otherwise the losses would exceed the capacity of the banks to
absorb them. i would expect to see some kind of protection that
woukl also extend to mexico and canada. i wonder how the
north sea producers will be protected. the problem will be a
difficult one for the european economic community to resolve.
how it is dealt with may determine the future of the common
market.
the problem of international debt has not gone away. indeed,
the debt of the less developed countries has continued to grow,
although some countries have been able to improve their debt
ratios. negative resource transfers probably reached their peak in
1984 and, as debtor countries insist on reflating their economies,
negative resources transfers are beginning to decline. the cohe-
sion of the lenders' collective has eroded. the run on south af-
rica, in particular, has driven a wedge between american and
european banks. in the united states, the interests omoney cen-
ter banks and regional banks diverge. the baker plan demon-
strates an awareness of the problem but it falls far short of a
solution. until a solution is developed, the system remains acci-
dent prone, although it is not clear where the next accident is
likely to occur. the banking system is now strong enough to with-
cide. -
stand a single shock; the danger is that several shocks may coin-

there is yet a third danger that will develop as the stock market
boom gathers momentum: the danger of a crash in the stock mar-
ket. at present, market participants are still very conscious of the
problems and as a consequence are quite liquid. but it is in the
nature of a boom that it attracts ever-increasing amounts of credit.
if a financial shock occurs when many stock market participants
are overextended, margin liquidation could cause an implosion
of stock prices. we are a long way from that stage: at present, a
sudden financial shock, like the failure of yet another bank, could

182 the real-time experiment
cause a short, sharp break in prices, but the market would recover.
i the bull market is likely to be punctuated with such breaks until
participants will cease to fear them. that is when we shall be set
up for a crash.
the financial system has been severely tested and the testing
is not yet over. the fact is that the system survived and the re-
cent changes in economic management improve the chances
that it will continue to survive. the process of credit con-
traction has been accomplished without a bust so far and one
can now see a way in which it could be completed without a
bust, albeit at the cost of a prolonged period of substandard
growth.
substandard growth is less than desirable almost by definition,
but it may meet the policy objectives of the present administra-
4 tion perfectly. it has been long recognized that conditions in
which goods and services are freely available are more rewarding
to the owners of capital than conditions in which resources are
fully employed. not only does a larger share of the national prod-
uct accrue to the owners of capital but entrepreneurs enjoy much
greater freedom of action. that is certainly the case today. the
reins of government are in the hands of people who believe in
free enterprise and encourage it to the greatest possible extent or
even beyond.
incidentally, japan has also found it advantageous, for different
reasons, to expand its economy at a rate that is decidedly below
its potential. japan wants to become a great power in the world
and the way to achieve that status is not by encouraging domestic
consumption but by maintaining a high domestic savings rate that
is used first to build up productive capacity at h ~ m e and then to
acquire assets abroad. japan has yielded to american pressure by
raising the value of its currency but it will change its domestic
economic policy only to the extent that is necessary to support
the yen.
one of the most potent reasons for expecting economic growth
to remain sluggish is that it suits the policy objectives of the two
leading countries. the constellation that seems to be emerging as
a sequence to the imperial circle deserves to be described as the
golden age of capitalism.
it is hard to believe that the golden days of capitalism could
come back again. after all, untrammeled free enterprise has pro-
duced horrendous results in the past. are we to repeat the same

phase 1 : 183
august 1985-december 1985
experience again? hopefully not. perhaps we have learned some-
thing from past mistake$.
the fatal flaw of a free market system is its inherent instability.
the belief that financial markets are self-regulating is simply
false. fortunately, secretary baker is aware of this fact and the
administration has behn to exert active economic leadership
since he moved to the treasury. certainly it is not laissez-faire
that has brought us to1 the threshhold of a new golden age of
capitalism but a concerted economic policy designed to counter-
act the excesses of a free market system. it remains to be seen how
well we have learned our lessons.
in any case, the benefits of the new golden age are very un-
evenly spread. it is in the nature of capitalism that the gap be-
tween winners and losers is rather wide. large segments of the
population, especially in the financial, technology, service, and
defense sectors, are flourishing. others, especially in the older
industries, agriculture, and the welfare sector, are suffering. for-
tunes are made in financial deals and shareholders wield more
power than at any timk in the last fifty years; at the same time,
bankruptcies are also at a fifty-year high, in both size and num-
bers. debtor countries are wallowing in depression and a whole
continent, africa, is starving; at the same time china is converting
to a free market system with all possible speed and the soviet
union is on the verge of moving in the same direction, albeit
much more cautiously.
why the reagan administration has been so successful in
achieving its objectives is a fascinating question. to all intents
and purposes the democrats have been reduced to the party of
losers, as manifested by the fact that it is the democrats who push
for protectionism in congress, while president reagan has an un-
questionable gift for making americans feel like winners. but the
improvement in sentiment has been achieved at the cost of con-
siderable deterioration in the underlying reality, as manifested in
our national indebtedness.
frankly, i have been surprised by the vitality of resurgent
capitalism. i considered the imperial circle as a temporary ex-
pedient that was bound to break down. seeing it replaced by
a new arrangement that can be described as the golden age of
capitalism, i must acknowledge the adaptability of the system
and its ability to survive. it remains to be seen whether policy-
makers succeed in containing its weaknesses: the inherent in-

184 the real-time experiment
stability of financial markets and the iniquities caused by
4 instability.

by more practical considerations. a cut in the discount rate may
not follow immediately upon agreement on gramm-rudman.
markets are firm and the federal reserve is cautious. the statis-
tics for december may lbok quite good, partly because the christ-
mas shopping season is crowded into fewer days and partly
because investment orders may be placed before the end of the
year to beat the changes' in taxation. the next advance indicators
may also look good because they include stock prices and money
supply. in these circumstances, bonds may be vulnerable and
stocks may offer better prospects on the upside. the thesis i have
just formulated is beginning to enter investors' ccneci~usnscses,
yet caution is still prevalent. the year's end is seasonally a strong
period: we could have some fireworks in the next four to five
