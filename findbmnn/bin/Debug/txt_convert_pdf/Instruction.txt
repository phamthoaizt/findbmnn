the legend script
instruction for using stylistic alternates and swashes
_____________________________________________________________________________

for using alternates of uppercase, lowercase or numbers in legend script you just
need to push special combinations.
for example: a.2,  b.2,  b.3,  c.2,  b.2  d.2  &.2  2.2  2.3  etc.

alternates for lowercase characters with protruding elements like b, d, f, g, h etc
(helps to arrange words in two lines more compactly).

or in adobe illustrator go to type menu and click glyphs. after you will see window with
characters.

in top of this window you need choose «alternates for current selection» in drop-down menu
(v – current selection on my example).
