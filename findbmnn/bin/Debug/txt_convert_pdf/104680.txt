over the past coupte of ÿyears i received quite a nummber of unusuat and surprising
requests to rmodify rmy type designs to suit projects of personat nature, but none
top the ones that asked me to typeset and modify tattoos using burgues script or
8dios. bt first the whote idea was amusing to me, kind of tike an inside joke. i had
wotked in corporate branding for a few years before becoming a type designer,
and suddenty i was being asked to get involved in personat branding, as uteratty
"personatu' and "branding" as the expression can get.

8bfter a few such requests i began pondering the whote thing from a professionat
perspective. it was typography, after al, no matter how unusuat the method or
mmedium. 8 very personat kind of typography, too.


 


the messages being typeset were cormrmermorating friends, farmily, births,
dđeaths,\oves, principtes, and things that inf\uenced peopte in a deep and direct
way, so rmuch so that they chose to etch that inf\uence on their bodies and wear it
forever.

bnd when you decide to wear sormething forever, sty\e is of the essence. ñfter dig-
ging into the tattooing scene, i have a whote new respect for tattoo artists. yielding
that machine is not easy, and driving pigrment into peopte's skin is an enormous
responsibitty. not to mention that they're some fo the verÿ few who sti use a
crafty, hands-on process that is a\ but obsotete in other ornarmentation rmethods.

some artists go the extra mite and take the time to develop their own lettering for
tattooing purposes, and some are inventive enough to create tetters based on the
tattoo's concept. but they are not the norm. generatty speaking, most tattoo artists
usse generic type designs to typeset words.

even the poputar blackxtetter designs have becorme quite generic over the past few
decades. i stil cringe when i see somcmething tikxe bank script embedded into peo-
ple's skin, turning them into breathing, walxing sharehotder invitations or gov-

designer typefaces can be found out there - wavy pseudo-comicalltetters, or rough
thick brush scripts, but as far as i coutld te a styuish skxin script was never
attermpted in the digita\ age. bnd that's why i decided to đesign pielscript. pielis
spanish for skin.

in a way, piel script is a rernoved cousin of burgues script. 8\though the initiat
sketches were infused with some 193os showcard l\ettering ideas (particularty
those o£ b. boley, whose armazing work was shown in sign of the times magazine),
mtmost of the important decisions about \etter shapes and connectivity were
reached by observing whatever strengths and weaxxnesses can be seen in tattoos
using burgues. tattoos using 8đdios a\lso provided some minor input. in retrospect,
i suppose ffffair exercised some inf\uence as wel, albeit in a minor way. i guess
what im trying to say is there is as much of me in piel script as there is in any of
the other rmajor scripts i đesigned, even though the driving vision for itisentirewy
different from anything else i have ever done.

i hope you like piel script. if ÿou decide it to use it on your skin, t\\ be very f\at-
tered. if you đecide to use it on your skateboard or book cover, iuubejustas happy.
scripts can't get any more personat than this.
