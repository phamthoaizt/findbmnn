allspice file guide & helpful hints!

thank you for your purchase of allspice!

your purchase comes with two font files: allspice and allspice-alternates. both are complete font files with over 340
characters, including full sets of accented characters for language support.

the letters of the regular allspice font can stand alone as their own font. most of the letters of allspice-alternates can do that
as well, although some of them (like the letters l, k, and r, for example) are designed to sit under or around the regular
allspice letters. i recommend typing your words out in regular allspice, then selecting letters and changing the font to allspice-
alternates to see what combinations you like.

and remember, if you’re mixing letters from the two files, you may find that you need to do some manual adjusting to get the
spacing right.
