thank you for purchasing los angeles!
here are a few tips real quick before you dive in:
non-english characters are available via the glyphs panel.
in a few cases with multiple-weight fonts, there have been installation issues where not all fonts
will remain installed at the same time (i.e. los angeles regular will install, but los angeles bold
will overwrite it). although this hasn’t happened often, i’ve included a workaround in the
“workaround” folder where each font is its own independent version instead of a variant. if you
have any installation issues, try this workaround to see if it ﬁxes the problem.
if you have any other questions, comments, or need anything else, i’m happy to chat via
creative market or you can email me at jenwagner93@gmail.com
enjoy!
