hi and thanks so much for your purchase!

in your download you will see two folders containing font files.  one is called hanley block ot and the
other is called hanley block non ot.

if you are using software that supports open type features, such as adobe products, please only install the
font in the hanley block ot folder.  these font files contain all of the characters have ot features such as
ligatures, discretionary ligatures, stylistic sets, swashes, ornaments and so on.

if you are using software that does not support open type such as silhouette, cricut, inkscape, ms office,
etc. please install and use the files that are in the hanley block non ot folder.  there are 12 font files
including one where the swashes for the script are pulled out separately.. these will all appear separately in
your menu and you can select your characters as usual, or you can access them through fontbook or charac-
ter map if you wish.  weâ€™ve included a character map to show you which extras and swashes are in the differ-
ent fonts.
