After several years this long time classic gets a facelift the size of Texas! The popular slab serif has been carefully redesigned to meet today’s standards for print. Basic Latin, Extended Latin, Cyrillic, punctuation, and kerning are included in the full version. The demo includes Basic Latin and Cyrillic. Because this is a titling display font not all characters are included so please make sure the ones you need are supported. Use Cowboys 2.0 for a t-shirt, logo, or poster. 

If you’d like the full version (which includes Outlines) for personal use send $25 USD to this email address. Please note that this $25 does not constitute a commercial license of any kind. Visit www.sharkshock.net/license for information on licensing. 

Thank you for your support!
