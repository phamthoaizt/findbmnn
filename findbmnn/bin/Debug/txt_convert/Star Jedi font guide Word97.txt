1.  Introduction

These Star Wars Logo fonts are based upon the official Star Wars logo typeface.
Star Jedi is a titling (capitals only) font, with a lot of variations and connections. Please, take a look at the charset tables and the samples below for details.
The Star Jedi family was created with the little shareware font editor Softy 1.07a by D.W.Emmett.

Installation: extract the contents of the zip file named “starjedi.zip” to a directory of your choice. You'll find:  starjedi.ttf     starjhol.ttf    Star Jedi font guide Word97.doc    starjedi sample.jpg    starjedi hollow sample.jpg    sample003.jpg    
This is what the zip file should contain.
Feel free to distribute the zip but remember to keep it intact and complete.
These fonts are freeware. To tell the truth they’re…“e-mailware”: if you like them send me an e-mail.

2.  STaR Jedi

Star Jedi is a bold font that reproduces exactly the original Star Wars logo’s typeface. The small letters are all capitals, while the capitals are serif variants. A few simple link-lines allow you to create complex letter groups, as it’s shown below in the samples chapter.
Besides, you’ll find some dingbats reproducing the whole Star Wars logo letter group, the Imperial and the Rebellion logos, etc.
