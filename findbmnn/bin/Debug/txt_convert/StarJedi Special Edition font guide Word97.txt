1.  Introduction

This Star Wars logo font is based upon the official Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition logo typeface.
Star Jedi Special Edition is a titling (capitals only) font, with a lot of variations and connections. Please, take a look at the charset tables and the samples below for details.
The Star Jedi family was created with the little shareware font editor Softy 1.07a by D.W.Emmett.

Installation: extract the contents of the zip file named “stjedise.zip” to a directory of your choice. You'll find:  stjedise.ttf     Star Jedi Special Edition font guide Word97.doc    stjedise sample.jpg
This is what the zip file should contain.
Feel free to distribute the zip but remember to keep it intact and complete.
This font is freeware. To tell the truth it’s…“e-mailware”: if you like it send me an e-mail.

2.  STar jedi Special edition

Star Jedi Special Edition is a bold font derived from the original Star Jedi. 
The lowercase are all capitals, while the capitals are serif variants of the lowercase. A few simple link-lines allow you to create complex letter groups, as it’s shown below in the samples chapter.
