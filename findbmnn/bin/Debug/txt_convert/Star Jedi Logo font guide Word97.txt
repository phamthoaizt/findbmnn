1.  Introduction

These Star Wars Logo fonts join the Star Jedi collection. Star Jedi is based upon the official Star Wars logo typeface. 
Star Jedi Logo MonoLine & DoubleLine 1 / 2 are titling (capitals only) fonts, with many variations and connections, the same of Star Jedi; they have also the capability to create single or double text lines Logos, in perfect Star Wars style.
Please, take a look at the charset tables and the samples below for details.
The Star Jedi family was created with the little shareware font editor Softy 1.07a by D.W.Emmett.

Installation: extract the contents of the zip file named “stjelogo.zip” to a directory of your choice. You'll find:   strjmono.ttf    stjldbl1.ttf    stjldbl2.ttf    Star Jedi Logo font guide Word97.doc    logomonoline samples.jpg   logodoubleline samples.jpg    
This is what the zip file should contain.
Feel free to distribute the zip but remember to keep it intact and complete.
These fonts are freeware. To tell the truth they’re…“e-mailware”: if you like them send me an e-mail.

Star Jedi Logo MonoLine is a bold font that reproduces exactly the original Star Wars logo’s typeface as it was in the basic Star Jedi font. The small letters are all capitals, while the capitals are serif variants. A few simple link-lines allow you to create complex letter groups, as it’s shown in the samples chapter of the basic Star Jedi font guide.
And here’s the new stuff of SJ Logo: 
Star Jedi Logo MonoLine is provided with special frames, decorative lines, logo fragments that will help you to display the single text line Star Wars-style logo you prefer. SJ Logo MonoLine is fully “compatible” with the basic Star Jedi (I mean you can alternate the two fonts, which differ for a few chars) and it can be used (and framed) alone, as you can see in the title above and in the SJ Logo MonoLine samples chapter.
But if you want to display a two text lines logo…you’ll need to use SJ Logo DoubleLine 1 & 2 (see below).
