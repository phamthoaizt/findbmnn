1.  Introduction

This Star Wars Logo font is based upon the official Star Wars logo typeface.
Star Jedi Outline is a titling (capitals only) font, with a lot of variations and connections. Please, take a look at the charset tables and the samples below for details and refer to the original Star Jedi collection zip archive.
The Star Jedi family was created with the little shareware font editor Softy 1.07b by D.W.Emmett.

This add-on zip archive must contain: 
starjout.ttf   
Star Jedi Outline font guide Word 97.doc  
Star Jedi Outline samples.jpg
Feel free to distribute the zip but remember to keep it intact and complete.
This font is freeware. To tell the truth it’s…“e-mailware”: if you like it send me an e-mail.
